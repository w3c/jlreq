  <section id="h_introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The W3C needs to make sure that the text layout and typographic needs of scripts and languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as people expect around the world.</p>
    
    <p>This page documents issues for a given script or language in terms of support by specifications or user agents (browsers, e-readers, etc.). </p>

    <p>A summary of this report and others can be found as part of the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html" style="font-size: 140%;">language matrix</a>.</p>
    
    <section id="workflow">
    <h3>Work flow</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 140%;">This version of the document is a preliminary analysis</span></p>

    <p>Gap analysis work usually starts with a <strong>preliminary analysis</strong>, conducted quickly by one or a small group of experts. Then a more <strong>detailed analysis</strong> is carried out, involving a wider range of experts. The detailed analysis may involve the development of tests, in order to illustrate issues and track results for browsers. The next phase is <strong>ongoing maintenance</strong>. It is expected that the resulting document will not be frozen: as gaps are fixed, this should be noted in the document. It is also possible that new gaps are noticed or arise, and they can be added to this document when that happens.</p>
    
    <p>As the gap analysis develops, the requirements for features that are problematic should be described in the companion document, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/jlreq/">Requirements for Japanese Text Layout</a>. Links to the appropriate part of that document should be added to this document as the material is created. Note that the requirements document should not contain any technology-specific information: all of that belongs here.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="prioritization">
    <h3>Prioritization</h3>
    <p>This document not only describes gaps, it also attempts to prioritise them in terms of the impact on the local user. The prioritisation is indicated by colour.</p>
        
        <p>Key:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li class="ok"></li>
        <li class="na"></li>
        <li class="advanced"></li>
        <li class="basic"></li>
        <li class="broken"></li>
        <li class="tbd"></li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>It is important to note that these colours do not indicate to what extent a particular features is broken. They indicate the impact of a broken or missing feature on the content author or end user.</p>
    <p>Basic styling is the level that would be generally accepted as sufficient for most Web pages. Advanced level support would include additional features one might expect to include in ebooks or other advanced typographic formats. There may be features of a script or language that are not supported on the Web, but that are not generally regarded as necessary (usually archaic or obscure features). In this case, the feature can be described here, but the status should be marked as OK.</p>
    <p>The decision as to what priority level is assigned to a described gap is down to the experts doing the gap analysis. It may not always be straightforward to decide. If a given section in this document refers to more than one feature that is broken, each with different impacts on Web users, the priority for the section should be the lowest denominator.</p>
    <p>A cell can be scored as OK if the feature in question is specified in an appropriate specification, and is supported by user agents. A specification that is in CR or later and has two implementations in 'major' browsers will count. This means that the feature may not be supported in all browsers yet. (At some point in the future we may try to distinguish, visually, whether support is available in a specification but still pending in major browsers or applications.) </p>

<section id="emphasis" class="advanced">
    <h3>Emphasis &amp; highlights</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Bold and italic are not always appropriate for expressing emphasis, and some scripts have their own unique ways of doing it, that are not in the Western tradition at all. Does this script require support for emphasising or highlighting text that cannot be achieved currently?  <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#emphasis">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aemphasis%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>For requirements, see JLReq  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/jlreq/#composition_of_emphasis_dots">Composition of Emphasis Dots.</a></p>
<p>JLReq lists the following ways of showing emphasis in Japanese.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a different typeface.</li>
<li>Use LEFT CORNER BRACKET &quot;「&quot; and RIGHT CORNER BRACKET &quot;」&quot; or LEFT ANGLE BRACKET &quot;〈&quot; and RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET &quot;〉</li>
<li>Change the colour.</li>
<li>Underline</li>
<li>Boten marks (aka emphasis marks).</li>
</ol>
<p>(1) and (2) are popular approaches. (5) is not as common, but is a traditional approach with some value attached.</p>
<p>(1), (2) and (3) present no difficulties. For (4) see <a href="#textdecoration">Text decoration</a>.</p>

<section>
<h4>Boten marks</h4>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/tests/repo/results/emphasis-marks">tests for boten mark support</a> that show that they are not supported by Chrome 63.0.3239.132 or Edge, but they are supported by Firefox 58.0 and Safari 11.0.3.</p>
<p>The expected behaviour for basic support of boten marks is <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-decor-3/#emphasis-marks">specified in CSS</a>.</p>
<p>Given that there are alternative ways of showing emphasis, and although there are already two implementations, I  mark this as an advanced need.</p>
<p>Additional requirements arose while the text was being written for CSS. They relate to text that is annotated with ruby at the same time as annotation marks. The conclusions were:</p>
<ol>
<li> Emphasis marks go outside ruby.     </li>
<li>If ruby only spans part of the emphasised word, emphasis marks stay as close as possible to the base.     </li>
<li>Where a ruby annotation is hidden or empty, the emphasis marks should continue at the same height.</li>
</ol>
<p>JLReq also requires that emphasis marks not appear over commas, full stops and brackets.</p>
<p>There are currently no tests for these behaviours, and no requirements in jlreq for the former (with ruby). <strong>Need to take a closer look.</strong></p>
<p>JLReq calls out the usual practise of using sesame shaped boten for vertical text, and bullets for horizontal. Controls for this exist in CSS, and tests show that it is supported by the browsers that support boten.</p>
<p>The default side for boten is to the right of vertical lines and above horizontal lines, according to JLReq. CSS controls allow this positioning to be set by the author, and in fact it is the default in both browsers that support boten for text where a lang tag identifies it as Japanese.</p>

    <h3>Bidirectional layout</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">When content can flow vertically and to the left or right, how do you specify the location of objects, text, etc. relative to the flow? For example, keywords 'left' and 'right' are likely to need to be reversed for pages written in English and page written in Arabic. <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#direction_agnostic">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Abidi%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

<section id="vertical" class="tbd">
    <h3>Vertical text</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are the script requirements for vertically oriented text met?  What about if you mix vertical text with scripts that are normally only horizontal? Do you need a switch to use different characters in vertical vs. horizontal text? Does the browser support short runs of horizontal text in vertical lines (tate-chu-yoko in Japanese) as expected? Is the orientation of characters and the directional ordering of characters supported as needed? <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/index#vertical_text">See available information</a>.</p>

    <h3>Other page layout &amp; pagination features</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Some cultures define page areas and page progression direction very differently from those in the West (eg. kihon hanmen in Japanese). Is this an issue for you?

    <h3>What else?</h3>
