    <h3 id="purpose_of_this_document">Purpose of This Document</h3>
    <p>Each cultural community has its own language, script and writing system. In that sense, the transfer of each writing system into cyberspace is a task with very high importance for information and communication technology.</p>
    <p>As one of the basic work items of this task force, this document describes issues of text <a href="#term.composition" class="termref">composition</a> in the Japanese writing system. The goal of the task force is not to propose actual solutions but describe important issues as basic information for actual implementations.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="how_this_document_was_created">How This Document was Created</h3>
    <p>This document was created by the W3C Japanese Layout Task Force. The Task Force has discussed many issues and harmonized the requirements from user communities and solutions from technological experts. It includes the following participants: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Japanese text composition
          experts (The editors of "JIS X 4051 : Formatting rules for Japanese documents").</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Internationalization and standardization experts in Japan (from Microsoft, Antenna House, JustSystems).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Members of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSL</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/core/">i18n Core</a>,
          Working Groups.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This task force also constitutes an important innovation due to its bilingual work-flow. Discussion is mainly conducted in Japanese, because
      of the Japanese <a href="#term.composition" class="termref2nd">composition</a> issues, but minutes and one mailing list were in English. To support  development, the task force
      held face-to-face meetings with participating Working Groups.</p>
    <p>The document itself was also developed bilingually, and is published bilingually. We carefully avoided
      using jargon for technical terms. Even if there were English words corresponding to the Japanese, we carefully studied any potential differences
      in the nuances of meaning, and if there were differences between corresponding concepts, we provided the Japanese
      jargon in romaji (Latin transliteration) for future discussion. Moreover, we prepared as many figures as possible, with clear
      and understandable English, to help non-Japanese readers. </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="basic_principles_for_development_of_this_document">Basic Principles for Development of This Document</h3>
    <p>Japanese composition exhibits several differences from Western composition. Major differences include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The use of not only horizontal writing mode but also vertical writing mode.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In principle, all <a href="#term.character-frame" class="termref">character frames</a> of <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic (cl-19)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> characters
          used in Japanese composition are designed in a square box, and these characters are composed without intervening spaces (i.e. set solid). In this document, notations such as <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic (cl-19)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> characters indicate character classes (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#about_character_classes">3.9 About Character Classes</a>).</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This document mainly explains the characteristics of Japanese composition along the lines of the following policy.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>It does not fully cover all issues of the Japanese composition system, but mainly discusses the differences from Western composition systems. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It focuses on the requirements for the Japanese visual presentation form of text composition. Technology-specific interpretations
          of the requirements and/or how to implement them are out of scope for this document. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It explicitly refers to JIS X 4051 "Formatting rules for Japanese documents" as much as possible. This document focuses on fundamental and important issues of Japanese layout as much as possible, and for more detail
          references the corresponding clause of JIS X 4051. The   JIS X 4051 topics that are not described in this document, are only  for exceptional, corner cases or to provide some specific line composition algorithms. On the other hand, some topics that are not described in JIS X 4051 are described in detail. Accordingly, this document is sufficient to implement Japanese layout processing for most parts of the Japanese market. </p>
        <p>In accordance with the stated policy, this document provides tutorial- or summary-like, supplementary explanations, related background, and additional
          descriptions for JIS X 4051 information. This document covers all the fundamental issues of Japanese text layout, but the reader will need to refer to JIS X 4051 for advanced  discussion of exceptional topics. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It provides typical examples of actual use for key composition features, to enable better understanding of their usage.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For non-Japanese readers, frequency of use is indicated for each requirement. These frequencies are not the outcome of any accurate
          research, but arise from the long experience of the authors. They are intuitive for ordinary Japanese text readers; however, for non-Japanese readers it may be difficult to imagine without explicit information. These frequencies are only
          rough information to prioritize the importance of issues. </p>
        <p>For example: "warichu (inline cutting note) is not frequently used, but is useful to simply annotate persons, things, and so on, at the place where the text appears, especially in
          classic texts or translations.",  or
          "ruby is frequently used in modern documents, including newspapers." </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In consideration of non-Japanese readers of this document, figures are used for explanations wherever possible.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Text layout rules and recommendations for readable design are different things, however these two issues are difficult to
          discuss independently. In this document, these two aspects are carefully separated. The aesthetic design recommendations are
          mainly described using notes. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The main target of this document is common books. The authors' experiences are mainly related to common books, and the quality
          required for common books is the highest in the market. There are many kinds of books in the market, and the requirements are quite
          diverse. The task force has a lot of accumulated experience in requirements and solutions for Japanese text composition. Nonetheless, many issues, which have been discussed over a long period of time, are applicable for other kinds of publication.</p>
        <p>In terms of frequency
          of use, the importance of magazines, technical manuals, and Web documents
          rates alongside
          common books. However, there are several characteristics in these publications, which are different from common books. These issues should be treated more fully in future documents.</p>

    <p><a class="sec_ref" href="#basics_of_japanese_composition">2 Basics of Japanese Composition</a> explains the characteristics of letters and symbols which are used in Japanese composition, their differences in <a href="#term.vertical-writing-mode" class="termref">vertical writing mode</a> and <a href="#term.horizontal-writing-mode" class="termref">horizontal writing mode</a>, and the design and adaptation of the <a href="#term.kihon-hanmen" class="termref">kihon-hanmen</a>.</p>
    <p><a class="sec_ref" href="#line-composition">3 Line Composition</a> explains line composition
      methods for <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic (cl-19)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> characters and <a href="#term.punctuation-marks" class="termref">punctuation marks</a>, together with ruby
      (inter-line pronunciation information and annotation) and <a href="#term.japanese-and-western-mixed-text-composition" class="termref">Japanese and Western mixed text composition</a>, i.e. mixtures of Japanese characters and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-27">Western characters (cl-27)</a>.</p>
    <p> <a class="sec_ref" href="#hanmen-design">4 Positioning of Headings, Notes, Illustrations, Tables and Paragraphs</a> describes
      construction methods and composition methods for <a href="#term.heading" class="termref">headings</a>, <a href="#term.note" class="termref">notes</a>, <a href="#term.illustrations" class="termref">illustrations</a> and <a href="#term.table" class="termref">tables</a>.</p>
    <p>In principle, characters in Japanese composition are designed in a square box and positioned without spaces, i.e. <a href="#term.solid-setting" class="termref">solid setting</a>. This is taken as a basic premise for the design of the <a href="#term.kihon-hanmen" class="termref2nd">kihon-hanmen</a>, the basis of book layout. Furthermore, to understand Japanese layout, it is important to understand the design of the kihon-hanmen and how to position illustrations, characters, symbols etc. in relation to it. Hence, <a class="sec_ref" href="#basics_of_japanese_composition">2 Basics of Japanese Composition</a> describes in detail the design of the kihon-hanmen and its dependencies. In particular, <a class="sec_ref" href="#page_wise_arrangement_of_kihonhanmen_elements">2.5 Page wise Arrangement of Kihon-hanmen Elements</a> provides prototypical patterns for the three guidelines listed after this paragraph: what recommendations need to be strictly taken into account, and what exceptions are possible. (The goal of these explanations is an understanding of Japanese composition. Since detailed explanations of the various elements of the kihon-hanmen are given in <a class="sec_ref" href="#line-composition">3 Line Composition</a> and <a class="sec_ref" href="#hanmen-design">4 Positioning of Headings, Notes, Illustrations, Tables and Paragraphs</a>, some explanations are repeated.)</p>

  <section>
    <h3 id="reference_of_definition_and_others">Reference of Definition and Others</h3>
    <p>The definitions of technical terms are described in the <a class="sec_ref" href="#terminology">Appendix G Terminology</a> appendix. Terms are linked to corresponding places in the Terminology appendix only at first appearance and in important places. If there is no appropriate English terminology for Japanese terminology, or the English terminology may possibly cause misunderstanding, the Japanese terminology is only transliterated to Hepburn style romaji notation (except that "m", not "n", is used  before "b", "m" and "p"). </p>
    <p>Also, the definitions of terminology in the Terminology appendix are basically the same as the definitions of JIS X 8125 or JIS X 4051, with respect to common Japanese usage of terminology. </p>
    <p>Each character class has its own character class number in parentheses. Members of each character class are listed in <a class="sec_ref" href="#character_classes">Appendix A Character Classes</a>, except for CJK Ideographs.
      Each character in this document is named and referred to using the character names of ISO/IEC 10646 (UCS). </p>
    <p>The formal title of the frequently mentioned Japanese Industrial Standard JIS X 4051 is as follows: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>JIS X 4051 : 2004 Formatting rules for Japanese documents </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> JIS X 4051 is available from the Japan Standards Association (http://www.jsa.or.jp/), but a PDF version is not available from JSA. The PDF version is accessible from the Japanese Industrial Standards Committee site (http://www.jisc.go.jp/), however it is not possible to download it. </p>

One method involves reducing by the same amount of inter-character space (<a href="#term.even-tsumegumi" class="termref">even tsumegumi</a> or tracking, see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig1_11-en"></a>) and the other involves determining  the amount of space to reduce based on the distance between the two letter faces of adjacent characters (<a href="#term.face-tsumegumi" class="termref">face tsumegumi</a> or letter face kerning, see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig1_12-en"></a>).</p>

            <p> In the <a href="#term.main-text" class="termref">main text</a> of books, the most reader-friendly approach is to use <a href="#term.solid-setting" class="termref">solid setting</a>. However, if the character size is larger, the distance between characters may become unbalanced, and tsumegumi will be applied. For example, there are books where tsumegumi
              is used with headings
              set in large character sizes. These methods are rarely used in books, since ease of reading is very important, but in magazines or advertisements there are many more examples of tsumegumi.
              Magazines tend to use type to differentiate themselves from others, and so devices like this are sometimes used for that purpose.</p>

      <p>The <a href="#term.page-format" class="termref">page format</a> of a Japanese document is specified by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> Firstly, preparing a template of the page format, which determines the basic appearance of pages of the document;</p>
        </li>

      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4 id="basic_templates_of_page_formats">Basic Templates of Page Formats</h4>
      <p>Generally, books use only one template for <a href="#term.page-format" class="termref">page format</a>, whereas magazines often use several templates.</p>
      <p>Although in books, as will be mentioned in c of <a class="sec_ref" href="#kihonhanmen_and_examples_of_real_page_format"></a>, there tends to be one template for the page format, the basic pattern is typically adapted. For example, the <a href="#term.table-of-contents" class="termref">table of contents</a> may contain small modifications. Furthermore, there are many examples of <a href="#term.index" class="termref">indexes</a> with a different page format than the basic page format, and vertically set books often have indexes in horizontal writing mode and sometimes multiple columns.
        This still holds true where the goal is to make the size of the <a href="#term.hanmen" class="termref">hanmen</a> for indexes close to the size of hanmen in the basic page format.</p>
      <p>Magazines gather articles of different kinds. Often the page format will differ depending on the content of the article. For example, one part may have 9 point character size and 3 columns, and another part 8 point character size and 4 columns.</p>

        <p>Establishing a <a href="#term.kihon-hanmen" class="termref">kihon-hanmen</a> may be seen as defining not only a rectangular area on a page, but also within that area an underlying, logical grid, to guide the placement of such things as characters, <a href="#term.heading" class="termref">headings</a>, and <a href="#term.illustrations" class="termref">illustrations</a>.  However, once a kihon-hanmen is established, there is no absolute requirement to align characters with the grid, especially when setting characters inside a line.  The only factors that influence the placement of characters are strong gravitational forces that (i) attract the first and last characters on a line to align with the border of the kihon-hanmen, and (ii) attract each line position to the line positions on which the kihon-hanmen is based.</p>
        <p>It may help in understanding the basic concepts of Japanese layout and kihon-hanmen to think in terms of a slit-based model, rather than a grid-based model. Each slit is the full length of the lines on which the kihon-hanmen is based.</p>

        <p>Depending on the application, character sizes can be specified in multiple ways. For books, character size is mainly specified using points or Q/q. Points are used for letterpress printing. In JIS Z 8305 (size units of printing type), one point is determined to be 0.3514mm. This is the size that is usually used. However, some  commonly used applications adopt one point as 1/72 inch, ca. 0.3528mm. Q was used for photo typesetting. One Q is 0.25mm. It is very difficult to unify the unit sizes for character size specifications, because actual users prefer the unit to which they are accustomed. In some companies, multiple types of unit are used together.</p>

The heading text is usually set in the centre of the rectangular space in the <a href="#term.block-direction" class="termref">block direction</a>, and indented from the line head. The size of the indent is usually specified as a number of characters in the kihon-hanmen.

Thus the same collection of <a href="#term.printing-types" class="termref">printing types</a> can be used in either vertical writing mode or horizontal writing mode, simply by changing the direction of text, (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig1_13-en"></a>).

        <p>For official (e.g. governmental) documentation, horizontal writing mode is recommended. Educational material (with the exception
          of certain topics) is mostly in horizontal writing mode. Readers of "mobile novels" are increasing, and it
          is expected that in the future horizontal writing mode will increase in this area as well. However, most of the large newspapers
          are written completely in vertical writing mode, and most of the large journals for ordinary readers are almost completely set in vertical writing mode. In addition, novels, which are the most widely read kind of book publication, are almost completely in vertical writing mode
          (some readers say that they cannot read a novel if it is not in vertical writing mode). Hence it can be expected that the importance
          of vertical writing mode for Japanese will not change for the time being.</p>

      <p>The various elements of a page should remain inside the
        boundaries of the <a href="#term.kihon-hanmen" class="termref">kihon-hanmen</a>.
        However, there are exceptions such as the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><a href="#term.ruby" class="termref">Ruby</a> or emphasis marks (<a href="#term.bousen" class="termref">bousen</a>, <a href="#term.emphasis-dots" class="termref">emphasis dots</a>, etc.) at the before edge of the hanmen, are placed outside the hanmen (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_6-en"></a>). The same applies in cases where ruby, <a href="#term.underline" class="termref">underline</a>, etc. appear beyond the after edge of the hanmen. Like the handling of exceptions mentioned below, the purpose here is to preserve the line positions established for the kihon-hanmen.  This technique can also be used for <a href="#term.reference-marks" class="termref">reference marks</a> associated with lines of text.</p>

          <p> When there are inline elements whose dimensions extend beyond the before edge and the after edge of a line of characters as determined by the kihon-hanmen, and when those elements appear in the first or last line of the hanmen, the parts that jut out beyond the regular line of characters also jut out of the hanmen area.
            For example, this is the case when the width of a sequence of characters which are set to <a href="#term.tate-chu-yoko" class="termref">tate-chu-yoko</a> is wider than the characters set for the kihon-hanmen. In addition, warichu (inline cutting note) or <a href="#term.subscript" class="termref">subscript</a> and <a href="#term.superscript" class="termref">superscript</a> (<a href="#term.ornament-characters" class="termref">ornament characters</a>) are handled in the same way.

      <p> In principle, pagewise positioning of lines relies on the line positions  established for the kihon-hanmen. This holds for lines with ruby or  emphasis dots as shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_5-en"></a>. Even when lines contain  characters that are smaller than the <a href="#term.character-size" class="termref">character size</a> used for the kihon-hanmen (as shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_9-en"></a>), the line  positions used for the  kihon-hanmen continue to be used as the basic guide lines. This is so that following lines with normal-sized characters still naturally fall into the line  positions established for the kihon-hanmen.</p>

          <p>There are several methods for positioning <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> at the
            beginning of a line
            (details are explained in <a class="sec_ref" href="#positioning_of_opening_brackets_at_line_head"></a>). Because an opening bracket is not a full-width character, in  cases where the indentation of the first line of a paragraph is a <a href="#term.one-em-space" class="termref">one em space</a>, or if the <a href="#term.tentsuki" class="termref">tentsuki</a> position is used for the bracket (that is, there is no space at the line head), the character following the bracket will be in a position which does not fit to the character positions established for the kihon-hanmen (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_14-en"></a>). However, the adaptations made during the alignment of line ends will ensure that the character at the end of a line is at a position that fits with the kihon-hanmen.</p>

          <p><a class="sec_ref" href="#line-composition">3 Line Composition</a> explains that <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> are <a href="#term.half-width" class="termref">half-width</a>. If these <a href="#term.punctuation-marks" class="termref">punctuation marks</a> and brackets are adjacent to <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic (cl-19)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> characters, in principle there should be a <a href="#term.half-em-space" class="termref">half em space</a> before or after the punctuation mark or brackets, so that
            these occupy in effect a full-width size. However, if they are adjacent to other punctuation marks or brackets,
            the half em space is not used. This is done to improve the visual appearance.  In such cases, the character positions are different than the positions established when defining the kihon-hanmen
            (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_15-en"></a>).</p>

          <p><a class="sec_ref" href="#line-composition"></a> explains the principle that <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a> <a href="#term.line-start-prohibition-rule" class="termref">should not be placed at the line head</a>. If
            by simple sequential placement these characters would
            appear at the line head or at the line end, some kind of adjustment becomes necessary. A similar adjustment is required for characters that should not be placed at the end of a line, such as <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a>. As a result of such adjustment, it may happen that
            other characters are placed at positions which are different from those established for the kihon-hanmen.</p>

      <p>The following recommendations should be taken into account when positioning running heads and page numbers with reference to the kihon-hanmen.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>When positioning horizontal running heads and page numbers  with reference to the kihon-hanmen in vertically set books, the amount
            of vertical space between the edge of the kihon-hanmen and the running head is a <a href="#term.one-em-space" class="termref">one em space</a> as established for the kihon-hanmen. If the kihon-hanmen of the book is horizontally set, take more vertical
            space than the <a href="#term.character-size" class="termref">character size</a> in the kihon-hanmen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Regardless of the direction of text in the kihon-hanmen of a book, horizontal running heads and page numbers on the left page
            should be aligned either at the left edge of the kihon-hanmen or <a href="#term.one-em-space" class="termref">one em space</a> to the right of the
            left edge. On the right page, the tail of the running heads or page numbers should be aligned either at the right edge of the kihon-hanmen
            or one full-width space to left of the right edge.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Regardless of the direction of text in a book, when arranging running heads and page numbers together on the same horizontal line, the space between the running head and the page number
            should be double or one and a half times the character size of the running head. On the left page, the page number should be set at the left side and the running head should be set at the right side. On right-hand pages, the page number should be set at the right side and the running head should be set at the left side. The exact positions of the page numbers are given by the instructions above (see b).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When positioning running heads and page numbers vertically to the <a href="#term.fore-edge" class="termref">fore-edge</a> of the kihon-hanmen in a vertically set book  (see spread (e) in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig1_28-en"></a>, for example), the minimum horizontal distance from the kihon-hanmen should be the same as that of the <a href="#term.line-gap" class="termref">line gap</a> of the kihon-hanmen.
            The top of the running head should be positioned approximately four kihon-hanmen characters below the head, and the bottom of the page numbers should be positioned approximately five kihon-hanmen characters
            above the <a href="#term.foot" class="termref">foot</a>.</p>

Therefore,
          the positioning of running heads and page numbers relative to those areas smaller than the kihon-hanmen is different. <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_17-en"></a> below demonstrates the respective positions of the hanmen for a table of contents and running heads or page numbers.

      <aside class="note">
        <p>In general, there will be only one page number per page. However in some cases multiple page numbers are printed								on each page as in the following examples:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>When a horizontally set index and/or <a href="#term.bibliography" class="termref">bibliography</a> appears at the end of a volume in a vertically set book, both <a href="#term.reverse-pagination" class="termref">reverse pagination</a> and <a href="#term.continuous-pagination" class="termref">continuous pagination</a> are printed.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>For <a href="#term.multivolume-work" class="termref">multivolume works</a>, both serial page numbers throughout the work and page numbers per volume are printed. </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </aside>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>In the double running head method, a higher-level title, such as that of the chapter or book, is used for the running heads on the even pages, and a lower-level title, such as that for a section, on the odd pages. Where there are no differing levels of titles, such as on the page containing the table of contents, the same <a href="#term.running-head" class="termref2nd">running head</a> is used on both even and odd pages.</p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>Which information is used for the running heads depends on the content of the book. Given that the main purpose
              of running heads is to signpost to readers what is written on each page, or the content of the current page, it does not
              make much sense to use the book title for the running head. The most common approach for a book with three levels of headings, such as chapter, section and subsection, is to use the highest  level heading (i.e. chapter) and the second level heading (i.e. section).</p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the single running head method, one of the headings between the top and third levels is used.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In principle, the contents of running heads will be the same as those of headings with the following differences:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Numbers and words in Latin alphanumeric characters in vertically set headings in vertically set books should be changed to horizontal notation for horizontally set running heads (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#major_differences_between_vertical_writing_mode_and_horizontal_writing_mode"></a>).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If headings are too long, they should be made shorter by paraphrasing them in fewer characters. Running heads with too many characters
                will not look good. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>For certain publications, such as a collection of monographs, the names of authors may be added in parentheses at the end of the running head.</p>

        <li>
          <p>In principle, the <a href="#term.text-direction" class="termref">text direction</a> of running heads and page numbers should be the same as that of the kihon-hanmen. For vertically set books,  however, it is more common to set running heads and page numbers horizontally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In principle, for the single running head method running heads are printed on all odd pages, and for the double running head method on all even and odd pages. However, for the sake of appearance, running heads may be omitted as follows:</p>

          <p>There are two types of page numbering. "<a href="#term.continuous-pagination" class="termref">Continuous pagination</a>" means that page numbers continue throughout the whole book.
            "<a href="#term.independent-pagination" class="termref">Independent pagination</a>" means that page numbers start from "1" separately at beginning of the <a href="#term.front-matter" class="termref">front matter</a> and <a href="#term.back-matter" class="termref">back matter</a>. There is also,
            for example in manuals, the method of starting each chapter from page number "1". (In such cases, it is
            common that the name of the chapter is added as a prefix before the page number.)</p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>If the front matter and the main text have different page numbers, each starts with page number "1". In this case, it
              is common to use Roman numerals for the pages of the front matter, in order to distinguish them from the main text.</p>

              <li>
                <p>Both reverse pagination
                  and continuous pagination. In this case, the page numbers for continuous pagination are in the same position as the page numbers of the main text, and page numbers in reverse pagination are in a different position (for example, if serial pagination is in the foot of the page, reverse pagination is in the head). Often other methods are applied to distinguish the different paginations. For example,  Arabic numbers are used for both continuous pagination and reverse pagination, but for reverse pagination, brackets are added around the numbers.</p>

      <p>There are some <a href="#term.punctuation-marks" class="termref">punctuation marks</a> that are used uniquely in either <a href="#term.vertical-writing-mode" class="termref">vertical writing mode</a> or <a href="#term.horizontal-writing-mode" class="termref">horizontal writing mode</a>. In this document, characters and symbols are treated as members of a character class, classified by their behavior for <a href="#term.composition" class="termref">composition</a>. Each class name is followed by class id, such as <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a>. Details are explained in <a class="sec_ref" href="#about_character_classes"></a>. The following are some typical examples:</p>

                <p> In horizontal writing mode, there are many cases of composition that mixes Japanese and Western text. The convention shown in (i) is a way to apply the same
                  comma and full stop
                  to both Western and Japanese texts for consistency, and is common in books on science and technology. The convention shown in (ii) was invented because in (i) <span class="character">FULL STOP "."</span> appears too small for Japanese texts and using <span class="character">IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP "。"</span> for period looks better. This convention has been adopted for Japanese official publications. (In the past, <span class="character">COMMA ","</span> and <span class="character">FULL STOP "."</span> were used for some official publications.)</p>

      <h4 id="positioning_of_punctuation_marks">Positioning of Punctuation Marks (Commas, Periods and Brackets)</h4>
      <p> The positioning of punctuation marks (commas, periods and brackets) in a line proceeds as follows.</p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>Basic processing of characters and symbols, including punctuation marks, which are subject to considerations of <a href="#term.line-head" class="termref">line head</a> wrapping, <a href="#term.line-end" class="termref">line end</a> wrapping and inter-character space adjustment, will be described in detail in <a class="sec_ref" href="#about_character_classes"></a>.

But when those punctuation marks are placed side-by-side with <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic (cl-19)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>, or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> characters, in principle, a given amount of space will be inserted before or after the symbols, which makes them appear as if they were intrinsically <a href="#term.full-width" class="termref">full-width</a> (one em) (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_8_1-en"></a>). Space is inserted before and after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-05">middle dots (cl-05)</a>. This principle makes the symbols consistent with <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic (cl-19)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> characters in character width, and at the same time the space for punctuation helps to make the organization of text clearer. The space size added before or after punctuation marks is subject, in principle, to <a href="#term.line-adjustment" class="termref">line adjustment</a> and may eventually be removed, except for that added after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a>.

        <p>In <a href="#term.font" class="termref2nd">font</a> implementations, <a href="#term.punctuation-marks" class="termref2nd">punctuation marks</a> can be given a different character width, but it is expected that the font is capable of following the line composition rules explained here to produce the final result. For example, when <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> are implemented with full-width size, it is possible  that a minus half em space is inserted between adjacent <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> (Some implementations prepare minus <a href="#term.half-em-space" class="termref">half em spaces</a> and <a href="#term.quarter-em-space" class="termref">quarter em spaces</a>).  In <a href="#term.letterpress-printing" class="termref">letterpress printing</a>, it was also common practice to combine punctuation marks with a half-width body and half em spaces in order to make it easier to remove the space later for adjustment. Because of that, the types were picked up except for the punctuation marks at the <a href="#term.type-picking" class="termref">type-picking</a> phase, following the manuscript, and the punctuation marks were picked only when they were necessary in composing a page. Later, with the increasing adoption of Monotype machines, punctuation marks with a full-width body became popular and both full-width and half-width punctuation marks have been used, mixed together, since then.</p>

        <p>Japanese composition is based on the design of full-width characters, but strictly following full-width based composition
          sometimes produces an unbalanced appearance. In such exceptional cases, the appearance of the resulting composition must
          be given higher priority than the full-width design principle. When and how to invoke such exceptional procedures has a direct
          bearing on the quality of the text layout. In other words, it is a matter of how to resolve the conflicts between the principle

      <h4 id="positioning_of_opening_brackets_at_line_head">Positioning of Opening Brackets at Line Head</h4>
      <p>When starting a <a href="#term.paragraph-break" class="termref">new line</a> with <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> there are some patterns as shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a>. Note that the amount of line indent after the line feed (the first line indent of a new paragraph) is assumed to be a <a href="#term.one-em-space" class="termref">one em space</a> across all the patterns.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The first line indent after the line feed is set full-width (one em) and the next line after the first line break starts with no space (so-called <a href="#term.tentsuki" class="termref">tentsuki</a>) (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a> ①).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The first line indent after the line feed is set one and a half em and the next line indent after the first line
            break is set to a half em (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a> ②).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The first line indent after the line feed is set at a half em and the next line after the first line break is set tentsuki (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a> ③).</p>

      </figure>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>Because the inherent character width of a bracket is half-width, <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a> ① can be explained as the result of applying the principle that any line should start with no space. On the other hand, the principle represented by <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a> ② is to assume that opening brackets should be always accompanied by the preceding half em
          space
          as if they were full-width and then apply the same principle as in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_15-en"></a> ①. JIS X 4051 adopts the principle shown in ① (the patterns shown in ② is offered as options) . The pattern shown in ③ was first invented in books such as novels, which use frequent line feeds and corner brackets in dialogues, for which the first line indent with one em
          
          space
          or one and a half em
          space
          (then this pattern was accepted and adopted by general books). Major Japanese publishers who deal with literature, such as Kodansha, Shinchosha, Bungei Shunju, Chuoh Kouronsha, and Chikuma Shobo, have adopted the pattern shown in ③. By contrast, Iwanami Shoten and other publishers adopted the pattern shown in ①. Because Iwanami Shoten once adopted pattern ② in vertical composition, there used to be many examples of it, but few examples of ② can be found today.</p>

      <aside class="note">
        <p>The first line indent of a new paragraph is full-width in principle. However, the following exceptions can be found.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>The most popular scheme is to set the first line indent of all new paragraphs to full-width. However, even if there is a paragraph break and the new line looks  like the beginning of new paragraph,  in contexts where the new line is a continuation of the preceding  line, the new line is set tentsuki as shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_16-en"></a>. (There are books such as novels which adopt full-width line indent without exception.) Similarly, in horizontal writing mode, the line indent is set tentsuki where the new line continues the preceding line of a mathematical expression connected by conjunctions such as "therefore".</p>

          <li>
            <p>When <a href="#term.heading" class="termref">headings</a> have no line indent, the first line indent of the first paragraph after the heading can be also
              set tentsuki, for cosmetic reasons. However, it is not recommended to set the first line indent to tentsuki for all paragraphs,
              because it would make paragraph breaks unclear. </p>

This half em space can be deleted for line adjustment (for more about line adjustment, see <a class="sec_ref" href="#line_adjustment"></a>). However, the possibilities are only half em space or solid. Other spaces, such as a quarter em space should not be used.  In principle, the <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-05">middle dot (cl-05)</a> character at the line end also has a <a href="#term.quarter-em-space" class="termref2nd">quarter em space</a> before and after, and is handled like a full-width character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_21-en"></a>).  This quarter em space can also be deleted for line adjustment, namely <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-05">middle dots (cl-05)</a> can be set solid before and after (about line adjustment, see <a class="sec_ref" href="#line_adjustment"></a>).

              though the half em space became set solid. The option of replacing the half em space after punctuation marks with a <a href="#term.quarter-em-space" class="termref2nd">quarter em space</a>, instead of removing the whole half em space was not used. That meant that there was the choice between either a half

Also it is possible to have a line break after <span class="character">IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA "、"</span> used as a decimal separator or an indicator for approximate number, and <span class="character">KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT "・"</span> as a decimal point. However, the position between ideographic numerals and <span class="character">IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA "、"</span> used as a decimal separator or an indicator for approximate number, and <span class="character">KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT "・"</span> used as a decimal point is unbreakable. The reason is that the natural usage of ideographic numerals is to write them like "二百三十五", that is with inserted rank indicators (Explanation: "二" means "two", "百" means "hundred". "二百" means "two hundred". "三" means "three", "十" means "ten". "三十" means "thirty"."五" means "five". The complete sequence "二百三十五" means "Two hundred and thirty five".). Hence, it is not necessary to express rank via position. In contrast, line breaks are forbidden for European numerals, since it is necessary to express the rank via the position. Furthermore, if in vertical writing mode European numerals are placed in an upright position like ordinary Japanese characters, they are used like the ideographic numerals, and it is possible to have a line break between them.</p>

      <h4 id="examples_of_line_adjustment">Examples of Line Adjustment</h4>
      <p>Methods of line adjustment processing are discussed in <a class="sec_ref" href="#line_adjustment"></a>. However, since layout processing
        of punctuation marks is one reason for the need for line adjustment processing, we will here introduce two main examples of cases where
        line adjustment processing is necessary, and show adjustment examples (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_33-en"></a>).</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The principal approach in Japanese composition is that with the exception of the last line of a paragraph, the length of all lines
            is the same, so all lines are aligned. As explained before, the line length is set to be n-times the character size established for the kihon-hanmen. Hence, as long as only full-width
            characters are used, all lines have the same length (see ① at <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_33-en"></a>).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_33-en"></a> at ②, there is an <span class="character">IDEOGRAPHIC COMMA "、"</span> followed by a <span class="character">LEFT CORNER BRACKET "「"</span>, and  the total space taken by the two characters is one and a half em. That means that the line overshoots or runs short of the edge of the kihon-hanmen by a half em. To restore a uniform line length, line adjustment is applied as shown at ③ in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_33-en"></a>. The <a href="#term.half-em-space" class="termref2nd">half em space</a> overshoot or shortage is recovered by <a href="#term.line-adjustment-by-inter-character-space-reduction" class="termref">reducing inter-character space</a> to a quarter em before the <span class="character">LEFT CORNER BRACKET "「"</span> and after the <span class="character">RIGHT CORNER BRACKET "」"</span>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>At ④ in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_33-en"></a>, the 15th character is an <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening bracket (cl-01)</a>. This should not appear  at the line end. Ideally, a full
            width space reduction would be applied, and the character "前" on the second line would be moved onto the first line in the
            15th position. In that way, the problem could be avoided. However, in this example a full-width space reduction is not possible,
            so line adjustment processing is applied as shown at ⑤ in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_33-en"></a>. The <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening bracket (cl-01)</a> is moved to the second line, and <a href="#term.line-adjustment-by-inter-character-space-expansion" class="termref">line adjustment by inter-character space expansion</a> is applied. That means that space is inserted in the first line at places where it is allowed.</p>

      <p>There are a lot of examples of Japanese text in which Western and/or Greek letters are mixed among Japanese letters. Examples
        are as follows: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Using one Latin letter as a symbol for something, like "A" and "B".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Using a Western word in a Japanese context, like "editor".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Using acronyms of things and organization names, like "DTP" and "GDP".</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Writing Western book titles and authors in lists of referred books with original spelling.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Latin letters are also used in <a href="#term.itemization" class="termref">itemized lists</a> and numbering of <a href="#term.heading" class="termref">headings</a>, as well as symbols for units, symbols for chemical elements,
        and mathematical symbols. As can be judged from these examples, mixtures of Latin letters among Japanese letters are in daily use
        in Japanese composition.</p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>There are some examples which include whole Western paragraphs in Japanese documents.  However, there are few ordinary books that
          include such paragraphs. There are a lot of examples of textbooks for foreign languages,
          in which one or more Western paragraphs are followed by annotations in Japanese language. Also, there are some examples in treatises and journals, which contain whole Western paragraphs.</p>

      <h4 id="mixed_text_composition_in_vertical_writing_mode">Mixed Text Composition in Vertical Writing Mode</h4>
      <p>As explained in <a class="sec_ref" href="#major_differences_between_vertical_writing_mode_and_horizontal_writing_mode"></a>, there are three different styles for setting Latin letters and European
        numerals in vertical writing mode:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Setting Latin letters and/or European numerals one by one in inline direction with <a href="#term.japanese-characters" class="termref">Japanese characters</a> (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_2_2_50-en"></a>).
            
            Single Latin letters or Arabic numerals are set with this style. In this case, a full width monospace font is
            usually  used. Currently,
            proportional Western style fonts are also sometimes used with this style. </p>
          <figure id="fig_2_2_50-en"> <img src="images/img2_2_50.png" alt="Example of Latin letters in normal orientation." width="115" height="432" />
            <figcaption>Example of Latin letters in normal orientation.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Setting Latin letters and/or European numerals rotated 90 degrees clockwise in vertical text mode (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_2_6-en"></a>). This style is usually adopted when Latin letters compose a word or sentence. Proportional fonts are specified for
            characters in this style, as in horizontal writing mode (or half-width fonts for European numerals).</p>

Tate-chu-yoko layout is usually adopted when dealing with a two-digit number in European numerals, or a combination of
            two or three Latin letters, the length of which is equal to the default size of the line in paragraph direction or longer
            than that just to an acceptable extent. (A combination of two or three Latin letters may be rotated 90 degrees clockwise rather
            than set  in tate-chu-yoko layout.) Proportional glyphs (or half-width glyphs for European numerals) are used
            for characters in tate-chu-yoko layout.</p>

      <p><a class="termref" href="#term.ruby">Ruby</a> is a small-sized, supplementary text attached to a character or a group of characters in the main text. A run of ruby text, usually attached to the right of the characters in <a class="termref" href="#term.vertical-writing-mode">vertical writing mode</a> or immediately above them in <a class="termref" href="#term.horizontal-writing-mode">horizontal writing mode</a>, indicates the reading or the meaning of those characters (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_1-en"></a>).

        <p>Societal change in the use of kanji  when composing Japanese and changes in the use of ruby implementations in text layout methods
          have been affecting the usage of ruby itself. Ruby was not very popular while the Touyou Kanji Table  (当用漢字表) (the list of kanji characters for everyday use, issued by the
          Government on November 16, 1946) was in effect because, in principle, it discouraged the use of furigana in its 'directions     for use' section. The <a href="#term.jouyou-kanji-table" class="termref">Jouyou Kanji Table</a> (常用漢字表) (the list of kanji characters in common use, issued by the Government to replace the <a href="#term.touyou-kanji-table" class="termref">Touyou Kanji Table</a> on October
          10, 1981) has changed the scope of the list. (The Touyou Kanji Table defined the list of all kanji characters that can be used for
          any documents, while the Jouyou Kanji Table was designed to be a 'reference guide' for the use of kanji to compose contemporary
          Japanese for general use in society.)
          For example, the preface of the Jouyou Kanji Table states that one may consider the use of 'furigana (annotations to indicate pronunciation)'  when the text appears too
          difficult to read. This is why the use of ruby has been increasing today. The use of ruby is common in magazines and books,
          and even newspapers have begun to use ruby these days.</p>

      <aside class="note">
        <p> The specification of ruby composition was first introduced in the second revision of JIS X 4051, which was further revised

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Jukugo-ruby : ruby letters are set not only in connection with each base character but also treated as a group as kanji compound word  (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#positioning_of_jukugoruby_with_respect_to_base_characters"></a> and <a class="sec_ref" href="#positioning_of_jukugoruby"></a>).</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p> PURPOSE: Ruby annotation with kana (usually <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>) to provide readings of <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic characters (cl-19)</a>.
            There are two types of ruby for this purpose depending on the type of base character: </p>

            <li>
              <p> Add one or more <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> ruby character to indicate the reading (Japanese onyomi or kunyomi) for each base <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_2-en"></a>).

In terms of ruby layout, attaching ruby text to a single character in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> is essentially the same as attaching the reading to a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> (e.g. attaching ruby text "バザール", 'Bazaar', in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> to a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> "市" is just like attaching the reading "いち" to that character). When attaching <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> ruby text to a run of base text consisting of two or more characters in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> and/or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>, the ruby text needs to be positioned as if it corresponds to the annotated text itself, no matter how the ruby characters are distributed across each base character. The most typical example of this is attaching ruby text to a kanji compound word to indicate a corresponding loan word in katakana (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_6_2-en"></a>). The use of ruby text of this kind is on the increase in proportion to the growing need for translations and loan words. This type of ruby, namely ruby letters that are attached to two or more base characters as one object (note that ruby characters are not limited to <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a>. <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_6-en"></a> and <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_7-en"></a>), is called <a class="termref" href="#term.group-ruby">group-ruby</a>. Group-ruby and it's base characters are unbreakable, because of their behavior as one object (it is possible to break a line in the middle of the base characters where <a class="termref2nd" href="#term.jukugo-ruby">jukugo-ruby</a> is in use).</p>

          <aside class="note">
            <p> Having said that, the layout of ruby text to a single <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> is not entirely the same depending on the use of ruby, and may differ according to
              whether it is for indicating the reading or the meaning. In fact, the <a href="#term.katatsuki" class="termref">katatsuki</a>, one of ruby layout per character which will
              be described in the later section, does allow the <a href="#term.nakatsuki" class="termref">nakatsuki</a> layout for those ruby which indicate  meaning. </p>

          <p> PURPOSE: Ruby annotation, usually with <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> characters, to indicate the reading or the meaning of a Western word used in
            base text (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_7-en"></a>).
            There are opposite cases where a synonymous Western word in Latin characters is attached as a ruby annotation to a Japanese
            word in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> and so on (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_7-en"></a>). These cases are less used than a and b, however they are quite common in study guides, translated books and travel guides. </p>

          <aside class="note">
            <p> There is no difference in the positioning of ruby text whether attaching ruby characters in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> to a Western word in Latin characters or attaching ruby in Latin to a Japanese word in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>. The ruby text in either case should be positioned relative to a run of base text to be annotated as in b). However, there is a difference in cases where the lengths of the base text and the ruby text are different. Details are described in <a class="sec_ref" href="#adjustments_of_ruby_with_length_longer_than_that_of_the_base_characters">3.3.8 Adjustments of Ruby with Length Longer than that of the Base Characters</a>.

On the other hand, when the base text or ruby text is Latin word, the word is set with western solid setting, and no inter-character space will be added to any ruby or base text in Latin characters no matter how different the ruby and base text look in length (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_7-en"></a>).

          <aside class="note">
            <p> The '<a href="#term.para-ruby" class="termref2nd">para-ruby</a>' method is further divided into the method of attaching ruby annotations regardless of multiple occurrences of
              the same base <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a>, and the method of attaching ruby annotations to only the first instance of the same base <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a>.

      <h4 id="choice_of_size_for_ruby_characters">Choice of Size for Ruby Characters</h4>
      <p> The <a href="#term.character-size" class="termref">character size</a> of ruby characters is, in principle, the half size of the base characters (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_9-en"></a>). </p>

      </figure>
      <p> The '<a href="#term.one-third-ruby" class="termref">one-third-ruby</a>' characters are  used on rare occasions to attach three ruby characters to one <a href="#term.full-width" class="termref">full-width</a> <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a>. One-third-ruby for vertical layout has the dimension of the half of the base character in width and the one third in height. Those
        for horizontal writing mode have the dimension of half of the base characters in height and one third in width (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_10-en"></a>). </p>

        <figcaption>Examples of one third ruby.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> When ruby is attached to twelve point or larger base characters (usually used for headings), the size of the ruby letter is generally smaller than half the size of the base characters, considering the proportion of the sizes
        of base characters and ruby. When all is said and done, these cases are very rare.</p>
      <figure id="fig2_3_11-en"> <img src="images/img2_3_11.png" alt="Examples of ruby at a size smaller than half the size of the base characters." width="269" height="218" />
        <figcaption>Examples of ruby at a size smaller than half the size of the base characters.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <aside class="note">
        <p> There are cases where the body size is twelve points in books designed for infants or aged people. In these cases, the
          size of ruby can be six points, exactly the half size of the base characters. </p>
      </aside>
      <aside class="note">
        <p> When the size of base characters is very small (for e.g. smaller than seven points), ruby which is half the
          size, will be even more small and illegible. In such cases where the size of base characters is very small, ruby is not
          a suitable method of annotation. In those cases, consider other annotation methods such as adding the reading in parenthesis immediately
          after the base character. </p>
      </aside>
      <aside class="note">
        <p> Slightly different from the question of the size of ruby, there is a question of whether or not <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-11">small kana (cl-11)</a> characters should be used
          in ruby annotations. Because the size is so small, there was no choice of using small kana in <a href="#term.letterpress-printing" class="termref">letterpress printing</a>.
          Today there are cases where small kana are used in ruby annotations, but taking legibility into consideration, these cases should be
          limited to those where accurate readings are needed, such as for proper nouns. </p>

      <p> In some special cases, ruby can be seen to the left of base characters in vertical writing mode, and below in horizontal writing mode, but this is very rare. </p>
      <p> There are cases where two kinds of ruby are attached, one to either side of the base characters, one for readings and the other for

      <h4 id="positioning_of_monoruby_with_respect_to_base_characters">Positioning of Mono-ruby with Respect to Base Characters</h4>
      <p> When <a href="#term.mono-ruby" class="termref2nd">mono-ruby</a> characters are Japanese, they are <a href="#term.solid-setting" class="termref">set solid</a>. If mono-ruby characters have their own character widths such as
        Western characters or <a href="#term.european-numerals" class="termref">European numerals</a>, they are set according to their own widths and then the ruby text is placed so that its center
        matches that of its base character. There are more variations depending on the combination of the base character
        and ruby text and accordingly various composition rules have been invented, which will be explained with examples. </p>
      <p> When attaching two <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> ruby characters to a single base character, the lengths of the ruby text and the base text are the same and they are positioned as shown

      </figure>
      <p> When attaching a single <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> ruby character to a single base character, there are two ways of positioning the ruby character. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p> In <a href="#term.vertical-writing-mode" class="termref2nd">vertical writing mode</a>, attach a ruby character so that its vertical center matches that of the base character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_14-en"></a>).
            In <a href="#term.horizontal-writing-mode" class="termref2nd">horizontal writing mode</a>, attach a ruby character so that its horizontal center matches that of the base character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_14-en"></a>).
            This positioning of a ruby character is called '<a href="#term.nakatsuki" class="termref">nakatsuki</a>' (center-alignment). </p>
          <figure id="fig2_3_14-en"> <img src="images/img2_3_14.png" alt="Examples of nakatsuki and katatsuki alignment." width="453" height="454" />

        <li>
          <p> In vertical writing mode, attach a ruby character so that the top of its virtual body is aligned with the top of that of the base
            character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_14-en"></a>). This positioning of a ruby character is called 'katatsuki' (top-alignment).
            For horizontal writing mode, '<a href="#term.katatsuki" class="termref2nd">katatsuki</a>' should not be adopted. If a ruby character is attached so that the left-edge of its virtual
            body is aligned with the left-edge of that of the base character, it would result in the loss of the center of balance, which
            doesn't look good (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_15-en"></a>). </p>

        on which alignment has been adopted for a single ruby character. There is another issue: how to maintain the spatial balance
        of the ruby characters hanging over those characters which are not related base characters. The adjustment of inter-character

This  will give a balanced appearance, and is the method specified in JIS X 4051 (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_19-en"></a>).

        <p> In letterpress printing, there were not many choices for adjustment of inter-character space between ruby characters. Therefore,
          depending on the number of characters in the base text and its ruby text, the choice was whether to add a certain amount of space
          before the leading ruby character and after the trailing character, or not. In the former case it had been said that for 2
          units of inter-character space between each c ruby characters, adding 1 unit of the leading and trailing space would
          give a balanced appearance. </p>

          Therefore, a criterion for deciding whether or not to adopt the method of JIS X 4051 is to see if the amount of the leading and the trailing
          space exceeds the full-width size (or up to 1.5 times the size) of a ruby character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_21-en"></a>). </p>

      <p>When the length of the ruby text is longer than that of the base characters, balance the base characters with the ruby text by setting the ruby text solid and adding a certain amount of inter-character space between each adjacent base character. To be more specific, for 2 units of inter-character space, add 1 unit of space between the start of the ruby text and the start of the base text, and between the end of the base text and the end of the ruby text, as specified in JIS X 4051 (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_22-en"></a>). Another way is to first align the start of both the leading characters and the end of the trailing characters, and then add a certain amount of inter-character space between each adjacent base character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_3_23-en"></a>).</p>

      <p> <a href="#term.emphasis-dots" class="termref">Emphasis dots</a> (also known as bouten or side dots) are symbols placed alongside a run of <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> characters to emphasize
        the text. </p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p> There are many ways to emphasize a run of text in Japanese composition. Besides attaching emphasis dots, one may emphasize
          a certain run of text by selecting a different <a href="#term.typeface" class="termref">typeface</a> (for example, Mincho face for normal text and <a href="#term.japanese-gothic-face" class="termref">Japanese gothic face</a> for emphasis),
          a different color (for example, turning to red for emphasis), by enclosing the text within brackets (for example, <span class="character">LEFT CORNER BRACKET "「"</span> and <span class="character">RIGHT CORNER BRACKET "」"</span> or <span class="character">LEFT ANGLE BRACKET "〈"</span> and <span class="character">RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET "〉"</span>), by drawing a line alongside the text (or <a href="#term.bousen" class="termref">bousen</a>, <a href="#term.underline" class="termref">underlining</a> the text), and so on. It is an editorial decision
          which emphasis method to adopt. Selecting a different typeface and enclosing text within brackets are generally used and
          popular emphasis methods. Attaching emphasis dots is not very common but one of the long-established and traditional methods typically

      <p><a href="#term.warichu" class="termref">Warichu</a> (inline cutting note) is a type of inline notation, where two lines of small characters are inserted into the text. Warichu divides a line into two sub lines. The frequency of use of the inline cutting note is not so high. However,
        the inline cutting note is very important for study guides, travel guides, reference books, encyclopedias and manuals,  because it is very effective for inserting notes at the point in the text where they are needed (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_4_1-en"></a>). Inline cutting note is usually used in <a href="#term.vertical-writing-mode" class="termref">vertical writing mode</a>. It is very infrequently used in <a href="#term.horizontal-writing-mode" class="termref">horizontal writing mode</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="#term.character-size" class="termref">Character size</a> for an inline cutting note depends on the  character size established for the kihon-hanmen. Usually, around six point size is used (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_4_1-en"></a>).</p>
      <p>The space between adjacent lines in an inline cutting note is zero, that is to say, there is no <a href="#term.line-gap" class="termref">line gap</a> between them (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_4_2-en"></a>).</p>
      <p>As shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_4_2-en"></a>, an inline cutting note usually has two lines, and is surrounded by <span class="character">LEFT PARENTHESIS "("</span> and <span class="character">RIGHT PARENTHESIS ")"</span> characters that are double the size of the characters in the inline cutting note itself. There is no space between the surrounding text and parentheses for the inline cutting note.</p>
      <aside class="note">

      <p>Symbols, like <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a> are also used in inline cutting note text. In such cases, the handling of such symbols is the same as for the <a href="#term.main-text" class="termref">main text</a>.</p>
      <p>In vertical text, the horizontal width of the inline cutting note area is wider than the width of a <a href="#term.kihon-hanmen" class="termref">kihon-hanmen</a> line. The horizontal centers of the kihon-hanmen line and inline cutting note area are aligned. The line gap used to establish the kihon-hanmen should not be affected by the horizontal
        width of the inline cutting note area.
        In other words, the line gap for the kihon-hanmen needs to be designed wider than usual in preparation for the use of the  inline cutting note. (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_18-en"></a> and <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_4_1-en"></a>) Warichu is used also in horizontal text, however it is not so common, and usually occurs only in study guides and encyclopedias.</p>
      <p>The length of the two lines of the inline cutting note should be as near as possible the same. When the inline cutting note can be set in one kihon-hanmen line, the whole inline note text should be broken at a position where line breaking is permitted, and where the two resulting lines are as close as possible to the same length. The length of the second line should not be longer than the length of the first line. Note that the same line breaking rules are used as for basic text  (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_4_3-en"></a>).</p>

For example, three to six characters are set in a 7 character space (based on the size of the characters in the running head (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_7_5-en"></a>). Two characters are set in a 6 character space to avoid too much space. Seven characters are set solid in a seven character space, and eight or more characters are set solid in a space of eight or more characters. This rule can be applied to other numbers of characters, such as five, six and eight.</p>

        <li>
          <p>The jidori text should be adjusted using spacing between characters so that the sides of the text are aligned at the defined length. The following, however, should be set solid:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Positions where line breaks are prohibited: inter-character spaces between European numerals; between two <span class="character">EM DASH "—"</span> characters; between two <span class="character">TWO DOT LEADER "‥"</span> characters; between two <span class="character">HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS "…"</span> characters; and so on. These sequences should be treated as a single block.</p>

Usually, the space before <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and space after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> is set solid. In jidori processing, the space before <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and the space after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> may be used for line adjustment, but the space after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and the space before <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> should not used for adjustment, because it is prohibited to break lines in these positions. <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_7_52-en"></a> shows one example with even spacing for all characters, a second example as explained here, and a third example that is set solid before and after the <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a>.</p>

      <h4 id="processing_of_math_symbols_and_math_operators">Processing of Math Symbols and Math Operators</h4>
      <p>Math symbols and math operators, such as <span class="character">EQUALS SIGN "="</span>, <span class="character">APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO OR THE IMAGE OF "≒"</span>, <span class="character">PLUS SIGN "+"</span> and <span class="character">MINUS SIGN "−"</span> are commonly used not only for scientific and technical documents but also for ordinary books. In the Japanese composition system, there are two different groups of math symbols, which are each treated differently. So in this document math symbols are classified into two different classes; <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-17">math symbols (cl-17)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-18">math operators (cl-18)</a>.</p>
      <aside class="note">

Also, the handling of inter-character spaces between these math symbols and adjacent characters is described in <a class="sec_ref" href="#character_classes"></a> as a complete table, in accordance with the concept of character class, described in <a class="sec_ref" href="#about_character_classes"></a>.</p>

      <h4 id="necessity_for_line_adjustment">Necessity for Line Adjustment</h4>
      <p><a href="#term.line-adjustment" class="termref">Line adjustment</a> processing is applied where inter-character adjustments are needed to bring the line end into the correct alignment, e.g. because of <a href="#term.line-breaking-rules" class="termref">line wrap</a> or other reasons. Within a paragraph, lines are created by separating character sequences at places where line breaking is not prohibited. Except for the end
        of the last line of a paragraph, it is necessary to set the head
        and end
        of each line at predicable,
        aligned positions. For the last line of the paragraph, it is still necessary to set the head at the aligned position, however the line end  need not aligned to the other alignment position. To achieve this, only inter-character spacing indicated in the table of <a class="sec_ref" href="#spacing_between_characters"></a>, or explicitly chosen  space sizes, are inserted, and other inter-character spaces are set solid. </p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>In Japanese composition, there is no concept corresponding to the Western "ragged right (flush left)", "ragged left (flush right)", or "ragged center". In Japanese composition, especially common book composition, usually only "justification" is applied. Note that, in Western composition, "justification" is usually applied for only word space sizes. In Japanese composition, it is applied for not only <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-26">Western word space (cl-26)</a> but also in several other places as explained in following text.</p>
      </aside>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>Usually, the last line of a paragraph needs no adjustment. However, when the last line of a paragraph is a little bit longer than the line length, inter-character space
          reduction is applied for <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> and at other places, if possible.</p>
      </aside>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>There is another adjustment processing, besides line adjustment, called "single line alignment". Single line alignment is applied to align a run of the text that is shorter than a given line length to designated positions. Details are explained in <a class="sec_ref" href="#single_line_alignment_processing">3.5.3 Single Line Alignment Processing</a>.</p>
      </aside>
      <p>There are various reasons for line adjustment processing. Examples of the most important ones will be given below.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Mixed use of characters and symbols (e.g. <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-24">grouped numerals (cl-24)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-27">Western characters (cl-27)</a>) where not all characters are full-width
            (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_51-en"></a>). </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sequences of <a href="#term.punctuation-marks" class="termref">punctuation marks</a>. For example, a sequence of a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing bracket (cl-02)</a> and a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stop (cl-06)</a> takes one and a half em spaces together (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_52-en"></a>). However, if an <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening bracket (cl-01)</a> follows immediately after the full stop, these punctuation marks will need two em size spaces together. Hence, no adjustment is needed to correctly align the line end (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_52-en"></a>).</p>

      <h4 id="reduction_and_addition_of_intercharacter_space">Reduction and Addition of Inter-Character Space</h4>
      <p>Line adjustment processing targets places with a predefined space size  or solid setting. Methods for line adjustment are as follows.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><a href="#term.line-adjustment-by-inter-character-space-reduction" class="termref">Line adjustment by inter-character space reduction</a>. This means that a <a href="#term.half-em-space" class="termref">half em space</a> is reduced after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a>, or before <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a>, and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-26">Western word space (cl-26)</a> is reduced
            within a defined limit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><a href="#term.line-adjustment-by-inter-character-space-expansion" class="termref">Line adjustment by inter-character space expansion</a>. Line adjustment by inter-character space expansion means expanding inter-character space for line adjustment, where inter-character space is allowed to be extended up to a defined limit, such as for <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-26">Western word space (cl-26)</a> or other places where it is not prohibited to extend inter-character space.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Normally line adjustment by inter-character space reduction is preferred. Only when there are no spaces that can be reduced is line adjustment by inter-character
        space expansion applied. The reason for the preference of line adjustment by inter-character space reduction comes from
        the thinking that characters in solid setting should not have more inter character space, if at all possible.</p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p><a href="#term.line-adjustment-by-hanging-punctuation" class="termref">Line adjustment by hanging punctuation</a> is a method of avoiding line head wrap of <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a>. This method is not formally defined in JIS X 4051, however JIS
          X 4051 does provide explanatory material about it. </p>
        <p><a href="#term.line-adjustment-by-hanging-punctuation" class="termref">Line adjustment by hanging punctuation</a> is a method which is only applied to <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a>. These touch the <a href="#term.hanmen" class="termref">hanmen</a> and
          are set in  a place outside the defined line length (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_54-en"></a>). This is also applied, for example, in books, in order to avoid the addition of inter character space and maintain  solid setting. However,
          line adjustment by hanging punctuation is not an appropriate method for dealing with a mixture of Japanese and Latin script text, since the latter principally does not apply line adjustment by hanging punctuation. In addition, there is another argument against
          line adjustment by hanging punctuation. Originally it was a method used in letterpress printing, to make the task of line
          adjustment easier. Furthermore, as shown at the end of line 1 and 5 of <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_54-en"></a>, if possible the <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a> are placed at the line end (the 18th position). In DTP there are examples of hanging punctuation
          like in line 3, but this may be regarded as unnecessary processing. </p>

          <p>Are characters and symbols appearing in sequence in <a href="#term.solid-setting" class="termref">solid setting</a>, or will there be a fixed size space between them? For example,
            sequences of <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic characters (cl-19)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> are set solid, and for <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-27">Western characters (cl-27)</a> following <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> there will be quarter em space. </p>
        </li>

          <p>Is it allowed to have a line break within a sequence of characters? For example, there must not be a line break in a sequence

        <li>
          <p>Is it allowed to use the space between characters in a sequence during <a href="#term.line-adjustment" class="termref">line adjustment</a> processing? For example, is inter-character

      <p>For each character class it is possible to describe whether the characters may appear at the line head or line end or not,
        the positioning method for the line head or line end positions (if available), the amount of space between sequences of several
        characters, and the combination with character classes before or after the characters (in a 2 dimensional table). In JIS X
        4051 this is shown in table 5 "Amount of space (between characters)". </p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>For the presentation as a two dimensional table, it becomes necessary for each class to have separate items about "line head"
          (the column about the character classes appearing before) and "line end" (the column about the character classes appearing
          after). If it is forbidden that the characters of the class appear at the line head or line end, JIS X 4051 uses an "X" mark
          in the columns for "line head" and "line end". </p>
      </aside>
      <p>Also, it can be defined for each combination of the character classes (in a two dimensional table) whether the characters
        of classes appearing in sequence allow for  a line break between them, or whether it is possible during line
        adjustment processing to add inter character space between them. In JIS X 4051 these items are also shown in a two dimensional table.
        Table 6 shows whether a line break is possible, and table 7 shows if it is possible to add inter character space. </p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>It is also possible to define for each combination of character classes whether it is possible to apply kerning during line

      <h4 id="types_of_headings">Types of Headings</h4>
      <p>In terms of text composition, there are four types of headings.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Naka-tobira or han-tobira</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Block headings</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Run-in headings</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cut-in headings</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>JIS X 4051 describes naka-tobira and han-tobira in "8.2 Handling of naka-tobira".</p>

      <aside class="note">
        <p>JIS X 4051 describes block headings, run-in headings and cut-in headings in "8.3 Handling of headings".</p>
      </aside>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>Punctuation marks are also used in headings, and usually used in the same manner as in the main text. However, sometimes, half em spaces before <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-01">opening brackets (cl-01)</a>, and, after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a> are changed to solid setting or quarter em spaces because of the larger character size of headings.</p>
      </aside>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>Some types of magazine use horizontal headings with extremely large character size, even in vertical writing mode, to emphasize the headings. Even inclined headings can sometimes be seen. However, in common books, only vertically written headings are used in vertical writing mode.</p>
      </aside>
      <p>Naka-tobira is used to separate sections of books. One whole odd page is used for the section title and the following even page is left blank. Naka-tobira sometimes includes author's names and illustrations, in addition to the section title (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_1-en"></a>). Some kinds of book, such as  encyclopedias, dictionaries and annual reports, use a different kind of paper from that in the main text.</p>
      <figure id="fig3_1_1-en"> <img src="images/img3_1_1.png" alt="An example naka-tobira" width="369" height="522" />
        <figcaption>An example naka-tobira</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Han-tobira is a simplified naka-tobira. The following even page is not blank, and is used for the main text.</p>
      <p>Most books are usually set using naka-tobira or han-tobira, even when sections need not be separated with naka-tobira. In such cases, at the very top of the main text, namely just after the front matter, one naka-tobira is commonly set to show the book title itself.</p>
      <p>A block heading is the heading occupying a whole, independent line. The main text is set from the very next line. Top level headings and medium level headings are of this type (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_2-en"></a>). </p>
      <figure id="fig3_1_2-en"> <img src="images/img3_1_2.png" alt="An example of block heading" width="369" height="522" />
        <figcaption>An example of block heading</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>Headings are sub titles, which separate and indicate  sub parts with one coherent set of content. Headings are usually classified into several levels, like naka-tobira or han-tobira, top level heading, medium level heading and low level heading.</p>
      </aside>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>The depth of heading levels depends on the content of the book itself. It is commonly said that the depth should be limited to three or four levels at most to make the structure of content clearer.</p>
      </aside>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>In multi-column format, block headings sometimes  span multiple columns. This style is called "dan-nuki midashi", which corresponds to "column spanning heading" in accordance with the terminology in Appendix G.</p>

        <figcaption>An example with Spanning block heading</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A run-in heading is a heading immediately followed by main text without a line break, and is usually used as a low level heading (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_4-en"></a>). Note that a low level heading can also appear as a block heading. </p>

      <p>A drop heading is a somewhat modified run-in heading style. The footprint of the heading is followed by two or three main text lines without line breaks, like drop caps (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_5-en"></a>). Drop headings are usually used for low level headings. </p>

    <section>
      <h4 id="elements_of_block_heading">Elements of Block Heading</h4>
      <p>JIS X 4051 describes the elements of a block heading as follows: top level heading, medium level heading and low level heading have to have a label name, number, heading title and heading sub-title (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_6-en"></a>). Note that the label name, number and heading sub-title are not mandatory. </p>

        <figcaption>Elements of block heading</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> There are several different styles of heading as follows: the heading is enclosed with symbols at the top and the bottom, rules (or thin lines) are inserted before and after the heading line, or the heading is enclosed with rectangular rules (or thin lines). </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4 id="font_selection_and_font_size_of_heading">Font Selection and Heading Font Size </h4>
      <p>Headings have a hierarchical structure. So, each level of heading has to have an appropriate visual style. The following issues have to be considered:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Character size for the heading</p>
          <p>The character size of headings should be selected as appropriate in accordance with the level of headings. For example, when the character size of main text is 9 point, the small-headings are usually set with 10 points, medium-headings are usually set with 12 points and large-headings are usually set with 14 points. The character size of headings is usually larger than main text, and the character size of higher level headings are larger than the size of smaller size headings. <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_7-en"></a> is an example of this principle.</p>
          <figure id="fig3_1_7-en"> <img src="images/img3_1_7.png" alt="An example of different character sizes corresponding to the heading levels" width="274" height="498" />
            <figcaption>An example of different character sizes corresponding to the heading levels</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>JIS X 4051 describes the character sizes for different heading levels below as informative.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>According to  table 1 in JIS Z 8305 (basic sizes of fonts), use a series of point sizes in the left column (for 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, the differences are 1 point, for 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 point, the differences are 2 points, for 24, 28, 32, 36, 40 point, the differences are 4 points).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Based on the character size of main text and scaling sizes with constant ratio. The ratio is usually 15% to 20%.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </aside>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>Small-headings are sometimes set with a Japanese gothic face and smaller character size than the character size of the main text. For example, for 8 point mincho main text, set the small-headings with 8 point Japanese gothic.</p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Type faces for headings</p>
          <p>Both mincho and Japanese gothic are usually used. Other type face designs are seldom used.</p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>Usually, the character size for main text mincho is 8 point or 9 point and the weight is light (Hoso-mincho). For such main text, heading font weight sometimes changes to a heavier weight for better balance (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_8-en"></a>).</p>
          </aside>
          <figure id="fig3_1_8-en"> <img src="images/img3_1_8.png" alt="An example of same mincho but different weight for headings" width="357" height="522" />

          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Alignment of headings (inline direction)</p>
          <p>In the case of horizontal writing mode, large-headings and medium-headings are in most cases centre-aligned. In the case of vertical writing mode, headings are usually aligned to the line head with some indent.</p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>The number of characters of line head indent for a heading depends on the heading level. If the heading level is higher, the indent character number is less, if the heading level is lower, the number of indent characters is more. The character size is based on the main text of the kihon-hanmen. The differences of character numbers are usually around two characters. For example, when the character size of main text is 9 point, the indent of a large heading is 9 point by 4 times, medium-heading is 9 point by 6 times, small-heading is 9 point by 8 times.</p>
          </aside>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>The reason the value of the indent is based on the main text is to align the top of the heading to the edge of the character boundary of the main text. Accordingly, so that the main text is set solid, the indent value of a heading is recommended to be an integral multiplication of the main character size (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_9-en"></a>).</p>
          </aside>

          <p><span class="index" id="d8e1013">Block direction footprint  of headings</span></p>
          <p>Generally, the block direction footprint  of any element of layout, including figures, notes and headings, should be aligned to the line positions of the kihon-hanmen. Accordingly, the block direction space is set based on a number of lines in the kihon-hanmen. This method is usually called "gyou-dori". "Gyou-dori" is a very complicated issue, and provokes much discussion, so the detail will be discussed in another section with examples. Details will be discussed in <a class="sec_ref" href="#processing_of_gyoudori"></a> and <a class="sec_ref" href="#processing_of_gyoudori_heading_set_in_the_bottom_of_the_page"></a>.</p>

Note that medium-headings are sometimes processed with a page break. Even when "nariyuki" mode is adopted, small-headings sometimes happen to be set at the top of new pages, also the headings at the very end of pages or columns are sometimes moved to the top of next page or column, for aesthetic reasons.

      <h4 id="processing_of_gyoudori">Processing of Gyou-dori</h4>
      <p>"Gyou-dori" is the process  of specifying the footprint of headings in the block direction by using the line positions provided by the kihon-hanmen as a basis and by deciding how many times they need to be used. The length of the footprint in the block direction is calculated as follows: (line width in the block direction) × (line number) + (line gap) * (line number − 1). However, when the heading footprint happens to appear in middle of the page or the column, the footprint has adjacent line gaps before and after, and when the heading footprint happens to appear at the top of the page or the column, the footprint has an adjacent line gap after. </p>
      <p>The following procedures are some of the ways "betsugyou" headings are processed based on the "gyou-dori" method: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Set the heading text at the center of the space specified with multiple lines of the kihon-hanmen. For example, when the heading is set at the center of a three line space, it is called  "center of three lines space". Following are some  examples (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_15-en"></a> et al). In these figures, gray rectangles indicate the main text, and dotted rectangles in the heading area indicate the space specified with kihon-hanmen text lines. Also, running headings and page numbers are indicated with gray rectangles. </p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>The character size of a sub-title is usually two thirds of the main heading character size. The line gap is usually half the heading character size, narrower than the line gaps of main text lines. In the line head alignment case, the sub heading is indented, and in the centering case, the sub heading is also centered. The main heading and the sub heading should not be separated across two pages or two columns. It is expected that the main heading and the sub heading are treated as one object. </p>
          </aside>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>When heading text happens to be broken across lines, the break point should be decided with consideration given to the balance of the line head indent and the content itself. It is not aesthetically good that the bottom of  the indented heading reach near the bottom of the kihon-hanmen. For example, proper nouns should not be broken, particles should not set at the top of the line. The line gap should be narrowed to be seen as one object. For example, line gap between  headings that are broken across lines is one third em or a half em of the heading character size. The second line of a heading that breaks across a line is set with inline indent. The  heading lines are treated as one object, and are not separately set across two pages or two columns.</p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Set the heading text at the center of the footprint specified with a multiple number of lines of the kihon-hanmen, and add space size  before and/or after also specified using numbers of lines of the kihon-hanmen. For example, when adding  space corresponding to the size of one line of the kihon-hanmen, it is called a one line blank space. Following are some  examples (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_20-en"></a> et al). </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Set the heading text in the space specified with multiple number of lines from the kihon-hanmen, with specific specifications regarding size. In this case, the size of  the heading block in the block direction is the total of the previous space, the character size and the after space, and the size should be the same as the space occupied by multiple lines of the kihon-hanmen. Following are some  examples (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_23-en"></a> et al). </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Set one line heading at the place decided by the kihon-hanmen design and set one blank line before the heading line. Blank lines may be more than one line, but such cases are very rare. This style is commonly used for small-headings. Following are some  examples (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_25-en"></a> et al). </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When headings are on multiple levels, set "gyou-dori" headings with different line spaces per heading level. There are two cases. One is the single  heading case, the other is adjacent multiple headings. In these cases, spaces in the block direction should look the same in both the single heading case and in the case of adjacent different level headings. To implement this design, in some cases, same level headings have different spaces depending on whether the heading is single or whether headings are adjacent. There are some examples in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_28-en"></a>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The heading is set in a block of multiple lines, which is specified by using the line positions provided by the kihon-hanmen as a basis, but is not set in the center of the block but rather specified by specification of line numbers and spaces before and after. See an example in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_28_2-en"></a> et al. </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Except for (d) of the previous section, when it is not possible to set the heading block at the bottom of the page, the block is set at the top of the next page and the remaining space at the bottom of the former page may be left blank (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#processing_when_one_line_space_before_low_level_heading_is_set"></a> for the case of the previous section).</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>When the low level heading with a one line space before comes at the top of the page, the one line space is always set before the heading. The reason is that the heading and the one line space before are regarded as one unified object. </p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>With this policy, the tail of the previous page fall into one of the following  three cases: (1) the lines of the before page are filled with text, (2) the last  line is set blank, (3) the last two lines are set blank. Except (1), in cases (2) and (3), the blank line before the low level heading is doubled (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_31-en"></a>). </p>

          <p>Set the cut-in heading with one rank smaller character size than the main text or the same character size as the main text, and with Japanese gothic face.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>It is better that the cut-in heading occupies a maximum of three lines and ten characters per line. JIS X 4051 determines that cut-in headings with up to six characters should be one line, up to twenty characters should be two lines and more than twenty-one characters should be three lines. When the cut-in heading has two lines, each line has half the number of characters of the heading text. When the cut-in heading has three lines, each line has a third of the number of characters of the heading text. If lines have a different number of characters, the last line may have less characters, and the remainder may be blank space. The line gap of two or three lines of cut-in heading is usually a fourth of an em of the heading character size.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The line indent of a cut-in heading is usually a half em of the base character size for the kihon-hanmen. The in-line direction length of a cut-in heading is usually multiples of the character size for the kihon-hanmen. The space between the cut-in heading and the main text is usually more than one em and less than  two em of the character size for the kihon-hanmen. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When a cut-in heading has one line, the heading is set in the center of a two line space of the kihon-hanmen and  two lines of main text are set following the cut-in heading. When the cut-in heading has two lines or three lines, the heading is set in the center of a three line space of the kihon-hanmen and three lines of main text follow the cut-in heading.</p>

      <h4 id="processing_of_column_spanning_heading">Processing of Column Spanning Headings</h4>
      <p>In multi-column pages, headings spanning multiple columns are processed as follows:</p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>In multi-column books, the top level heading for the start page  usually spans all columns designed  in the kihon-hanmen. In common magazines, the title of the start page of an article usually spans all columns designed in the kihon-hanmen. There are examples where  medium headings do not span not  all columns. </p>
      </aside>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>A spanning heading spanning  all columns in the kihon-hanmen is usually set at the top of the page after the page break or new recto. However, there are cases where full spanning headings are set  around the middle of the page. In such cases, main text lines are turned back before the heading block, including before headings that are not full spanning headings (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_38-en"></a>). </p>

          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When turning back main text before a spanning block, if the divided text lines are not same, the last column has less lines and remaining blank lines may be left as is (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_39-en"></a>). In vertical writing mode, the  column with the least number of lines is the  column nearest the bottom, and in horizontal writing mode, the column with the least number of lines is the right-most column. </p>

        <li>
          <p>The less spanning block headings are usually set in the middle of the page. In these cases, the way in which  multi column  heading blocks are set is decided as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>When setting main text lines in multiple columns, if the spanning block heading appears in the first column, the spanning heading block is set to start from the first column (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_40-en"></a>). </p>

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>When main text lines are set following the multi column region, if a spanning block heading does not appear in  the top column, the heading is set in that column or in the previous column. If the heading block appears before the block direction center of the column, the heading is set from the previous column (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_41-en"></a>). If the heading block appears after the block direction center of the column, the heading is set from that column itself (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_42-en"></a>). Note that if the line direction bottom of the heading block runs out of the hanmen, the heading block is set from previous columns (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1_43-en"></a>). </p>

      <p>The following kinds of notes are used in Japanese text layout, besides notes between <span class="character">LEFT PARENTHESIS "("</span> and <span class="character">RIGHT PARENTHESIS ")"</span> or warichu:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Endnotes: Notes used both in horizontal writing mode and vertical writing mode, set after a paragraph, a clause, a chapter or the whole base text. In vertical writing mode this type is most frequently used (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_1-en"></a>). In horizontal writing mode, the frequency of this type is second  after footnotes (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_1_2-en"></a>).</p>

          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Headnotes (in vertical writing mode) : Notes set above the kihon-hanmen  in vertical writing mode. The area for the headnote is reserved at the upper part of the kihon-hanmen when the kihon-hanmen is designed, and  notes related to a page or spread are set in the same page or spread (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_2-en"></a>). Headnotes are frequently used as explanations for words and idioms of Japanese classic texts. Japanese classic texts are sometimes set with three vertical areas, the top area is used for head notes, the middle area is used for the original text and the bottom area is used for a modern Japanese translation.</p>

          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Footnotes (in horizontal writing mode) : Notes set beneath the kihon-hanmen (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_3-en"></a>). In horizontal writing mode, footnotes are the most frequently used note style.</p>

          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Footnotes (in vertical writing mode) : The area for the footnote for vertical writing mode is reserved at the bottom  of the kihon-hanmen beforehand, when the kihon-hanmen is designed, and notes are set in this area. This is similar to a headnote, but the location is beneath the base text. It is used in Japanese classic texts and keimousho (enlightening books), as explanations for technical terms. When illustrations are included in the footnote, basically the illustrations should be set within the footnote area (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_4-en"></a>).</p>

          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sidenotes (in vertical writing mode) : In vertical writing mode, related notes in a spread are set in the fore-edge of the left (recto) page (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_5-en"></a>). In vertical writing mode, sidenotes are not frequently used. However, this style may be used more frequently, because for the reader this style causes minimal disturbance when following the flow of the base text, and the notes can be set very near to the related base text.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sidenotes (in horizontal writing mode) : In horizontal writing mode an area for a sidenote is reserved at the fore-edge side when the kihon-hanmen is designed, and the  notes related to the page are set in the sidenote area of the same page (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_6-en"></a>). Related illustrations are also set in the area. There are cases where sidenotes in horizontal writing style are set not in the fore-edge but right side of both recto and verso pages (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_7-en"></a>). There are not so many cases of sidenotes in horizontal writing style. This style is sometimes used for keimousho (enlightening books) with many illustrations.</p>

      <h4 id="the_processing_of_the_reference_mark">The Processing of the Reference Mark</h4>
      <p>There are two styles for setting reference marks (<a class="characterClass" href="#cl-20">characters as reference marks (cl-20)</a>). One is to set the reference mark adjacent to the target word and on the interlinear right side (in vertical writing mode) or interlinear upper side (in horizontal writing mode). The other is to set the reference mark in the line just after the target word. </p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p><a class="characterClass" href="#cl-20">characters as reference marks (cl-20)</a> When the target word is at the bottom of the sentence, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-20">characters as reference marks (cl-20)</a> are set before the <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a>. There is another method that sets the <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-20">characters as reference marks (cl-20)</a> after the <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a>, but this method is very rare.</p>
      </aside>
      <p>The method where the reference mark is set on the right side (vertical writing mode) or above (horizontal writing mode) is as follows (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_12-en"></a>, <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_13-en"></a>).</p>

      <h4 id="processing_of_endnotes_in_vertical_writing_mode_or_horizontal_writing_mode">Processing of Endnotes in Vertical Writing Mode or Horizontal Writing Mode</h4>
      <p>The following figure is a common example of endnotes set at the end of paragraphs in vertical writing mode (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_16-en"></a>).</p>
      <figure id="fig3_2_16-en"> <img src="images/img3_2_16.png" alt="An example of endnotes set  at the end of paragraphs in vertical writing mode" width="371" height="525" />
        <figcaption>An example of endnotes set  at the end of paragraphs in vertical writing mode</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Specific issues related to setting endnotes in vertical writing mode or horizontal writing mode include the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The character size of endnotes should be one or two levels smaller than the character size of the base text in the kihon-hanmen.</p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>For example, when the character size of the base text is nine points, the character size of endnotes in B6 size or four by six size is seven points, and in A5 size is eight points or seven points.</p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The indent  length should be around two characters sizes of the base text in the kihon-hanmen. The line length of endnotes should be an integer-based number of times the endnote character size. The bottom of the endnote line should be set aligned with the bottom edge of the kihon-hanmen or column area. Accordingly, the indent length of endnotes needs to be adjusted and the length may sometimes differ by an integer-based number of units based on the base character size of the kihon-hanmen.</p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>For example, supposing the character size of the base text in the kihon-hanmen is nine points and one line contains forty three characters, the character size of the endnote is seven points, the indent length is calculated as follows:</p>
            <table class="t_sample">
              <tr>
                <td class="ft"><p>line length of base text</p></td>
                <td class="ft"><p><span class="expr">387 point = 9 point × 43 characters</span></p></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="ft"><p>convert to 7 point based line length</p></td>
                <td class="ft"><p><span class="expr">387 point = 7 point × 55 characters + 2 point</span></p></td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Suppose the line length of the endnote is 7 points by 53 characters, the length of indent is 16 points with following calculation:</p>
            <table class="t_sample">
              <tr>
                <td class="ft"><p><span class="expr">16 point = 387 point − 7 point × 53 characters</span></p></td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Suppose line length of the endnote is 7 points by 52 characters, indent length is 23 points with following calculation:</p>
            <table class="t_sample">
              <tr>
                <td class="ft"><p><span class="expr">23 point = 387 point − 7 point × 52 characters</span></p></td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Accordingly, in this case, the indent length of the endnote is 16 points or 23 points.</p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The inter-letter space after the head endnote number is usually the size of a full-width  character  of the endnote.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When the endnote is two lines or more, the second line and after are indented one or two full-width character sizes longer than the first line.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Line gaps of endnotes are narrower than the line gap of the kihon-hanmen because of the smaller character size of endnotes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When  new chapters are begun after a page break or new recto, endnotes are set just before the page or page break or new recto, and the space after the endnote may be left as is. Only the line gap between the base text and the endnote should be specified. However, when the endnotes are set between paragraphs, the line gap before and after the endnote becomes an issue. Basically, the minimum size of line gaps between the endnote and the base text, before and after, is the line gap decided for the kihon-hanmen, and usually, the line at the end of the hanmen or a column is aligned with the bottom of the hanmen or the column. In these cases, the fraction of line gap is basically adjusted by the increase of the line gap after the endnote, but when the endnote comes to the end of the hanmen or the column, the line gap before the endnote is increased (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_17-en"></a>).</p>

      <h4 id="processing_of_footnotes_in_horizontal_writing_mode">Processing of Footnotes in Horizontal Writing Mode</h4>
      <p>Setting positions of footnotes in horizontal writing mode are at the bottom of the hanmen in the page where the target words and the reference marks appear in one column, and at the bottom of the column space where the target words and the reference marks appear in two or more columns. When footnotes overflow from the hanmen or the column, the overflowed part of the footnotes is inserted before the footnotes of the next page or next column.</p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>In the case of multiple columns, footnotes are set at the bottom of the column where corresponding reference marks appear (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_18-en"></a>). However, there are cases where all footnotes in the page are set at the bottom of the hanmen with one column (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_19-en"></a>).</p>

      <aside class="note">
        <p>When footnotes are set just before  page breaks or new rectos, footnotes are set aligned with the bottom of the kihon-hanmen including rules, and spaces between base text and footnotes are used for the alignment (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_20-en"></a>). There are cases where footnotes are set continuously following the base text and the space after footnotes is left as is, but in Japan these cases are few (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_21-en"></a>).</p>

      <aside class="note">
        <p>When some part of a footnote overflows to the next page or the next column, it is recommended to set an arrow symbol or similar symbol at the very end of the part of the footnote set in the page or the column where the corresponding reference mark appears, to indicate that the footnote is continuing to the next page or the next column. Especially, when the overflowed part of the footnote is set in an even page, such guidance is very useful. To put it the other way around, it is better to avoid such cases. Treating such cases is not a matter of type setting methodology but  of editorial issues. One editorial solution is to change the position of the reference mark by modification of the page layout. </p>

      <p>Following figure is an common example of footnotes in horizontal writing mode (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_22-en"></a>).</p>

      <p>The following items are outstanding issues when setting footnotes in horizontal writing mode:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The character size of footnotes is one or two levels smaller than the character size of the base text in the kihon-hanmen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Usually footnotes are accompanied by lines to separate the base text and footnotes (i.e. rules), indentation is not needed.  However because the line length of footnotes should be multiples of the character size of footnotes,  the difference in line length of the base text and line length of footnotes is adjusted with the insertion of left side spaces and the bottom of footnote is aligned with the kihon-hanmen or column area.</p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>For example, when the base text line length is nine point by thirty four characters and footnote character size is seven point, the remaining spaces of footnotes are calculated as follows:</p>
            <table class="t_sample">
              <tr>

              </tr>
            </table>
            <p>When line length of footnotes is set as seven point by forty three  characters, the space inserted in the left side of footnote lines is 5 point.</p>
          </aside>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>For example, when base text line length is 9 point by thirty five characters and footnote character size is seven point, the left spaces of footnotes are calculated as follows:</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The inter-character space between footnote numbers at the top of the line and footnote text is usually a full-width of footnote text character in size.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When a footnote has two or more lines, the second line or below is indented by one em space, or the first line is indented by one em space of footnote character size (<a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_23-en"></a>).</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Line gaps of footnotes are narrower according to the smaller size of footnote characters. The line gap of footnotes is recommended to be a half em of a footnote character size or slightly narrower, depending on the base text line gap.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A line called a rule is inserted between the base text and footnotes to distinguish the footprint of the footnotes. For this purpose, a thin border is used. The length of the line is usually one third of the line length of the kihon-hanmen, depending on the kihon-hanmen design. The left side of the line is aligned to the left side of the hanmen or column.  The line gap between the line and the footnote is slightly wider than the usual line gap among footnotes.</p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>There are cases without the line between base text and footnotes, but in Japan these cases are few.</p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The minimum size of line gaps among base text, the rule, and footnotes is a line gap size of the base text in the kihon-hanmen. The bottom line of footnotes is aligned to the edge of the kihon-hanmen or column area. Accordingly, fractions will appear. This fraction is inserted between the base text area and the rule. Accordingly, the fraction between the rule and the base text area will change between the line gap of the kihon-hanmen and the character size plus line gap of the kihon-hanmen.</p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>When rules are not used between base text and footnotes, the line gap between base text and footnotes is set wider than the usual line gap between base text of kihon-hanmen. For example, when the character size of the base text in the kihon-hanmen is nine point, the minimum size of the line gap between the base text and the footnotes is twelve point. Usually, it is recommended that the minimum size of the line gap between the base text and the footnotes is  set larger than the character size of the base text in the kihon-hanmen.</p>

      <p>The following figure is a common example of sidenotes in vertical writing mode (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_24-en"></a>).</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Side notes in vertical writing mode are similar to footnotes in horizontal writing mode. Accordingly, general methods for footnotes in horizontal writing mode can be applied to sidenotes in vertical writing mode. The following items are outstanding issues only applied to sidenotes in vertical writing mode:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Side notes in vertical writing mode are set at the left side of the odd page of the spread to which corresponding reference marks appear. In multiple columns, sidenotes are aligned to the left side of the lowest column. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When the volume of sidenotes is too great, the sidenotes may overflow to the even page. In multiple columns, the sidenotes may overflow to the column above.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When it is not possible to set any sidenotes or some of the sidenotes in a spread, the overflowed part may be inserted before the sidenotes corresponding to the next reference mark in an odd page or the lowest column in an odd page of the next spread.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In  pages just before a page break or a new recto, the sidenotes are set in the last page of the section following the base text, even if the last page is even. If it is not possible to set the side notes in the page, the  part of the notes that juts out is  set from the top of the next page or the top of the first column, then the page is followed by page break or new recto.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In the above cases, the remaining space is usually inserted after the sidenote, unlike the case where footnotes are inserted between the base text and the footnotes in horizontal writing mode.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A thin line is inserted between  the base text and sidenotes to distinguish them. The line is a thin border. The length of the line depends on the line length of the kihon-hanmen, but is usually one third of the line length, and the top end of the line is aligned to the top edge of the kihon-hanmen. It is recommended that the gap between the line and the sidenotes is a little bit wider than for footnote cases.</p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>There are cases when the lines to distinguish base text and sidenotes are not inserted.</p>

        <li>
          <p>The minimum value of the line gap between the line to distinguish the base text and sidenotes is the value of line gap decided in the kihon-hanmen. The left side of the last line of the sidenotes is aligned to the left edge of the kihon-hanmen or the column. Accordingly, a fraction space in the block direction is inserted between the base text area and the rule, and  the fraction between the rule and the base text area will change between the line gap of the kihon-hanmen and the character size plus line gap of the kihon-hanmen.</p>

          <p>Set parallel-notes in the same spread where the corresponding main text positions appear without reference marks. Only the key words are emphasized with a difference of font style (ex. Japanese Gothic).</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are some  issues specific to setting parallel-notes as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The character size of parallel-notes is one or two ranks smaller than the character size of main text in the kihon-hanmen.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The line length of parallel-notes is an integer based multiple of the character size of notes. It depends on the book size; around fifteen characters to twenty characters in a line is recommended. In some cases around twenty five characters is acceptable.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The line gap of parallel-notes is basically a half em of the character size of the parallel-notes. When the volume of parallel-notes is high, there are cases of one third em.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The size of the parallel-note area in the block direction is the same as the size of the main text in the kihon-hanmen.</p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>The size of the main text in the kihon-hanmen in the block direction is calculated with character size, number of lines and line gap. The block direction size of the parallel-note area is the same with regards to the result of the calculation. Accordingly, the block direction size of the parallel-note area might be different from the result of following calculation: (character size of parallel-note) × (number of lines of parallel-note + line gap of note × (number of lines of parallel-note − 1).</p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>It is recommended to set the space between parallel-notes and the main text in inline direction at around double the em character size of the main text in the kihon-hanmen. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Usually, indentation of the second line and after, like end notes,  is not applied to parallel-notes. In the majority of cases, the first line of a parallel-note is set as tentsuki. There are cases where the first line is indented by one a em character size of the parallel-notes, like common paragraphs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The inter-letter space between the note number  and the following parallel-note text is around one em of a parallel-note character size. There are cases where the note number and target word are changed to a different font style (ex. Japanese Gothic) and the note number and the  target word are set solid. The inter-letter space between the target word and parallel-note text is one em of the parallel-note text size (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_25-en"></a>).</p>

          </figure>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The setting  of parallel-notes and the main text area is as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>The position of target text and the position of a parallel-note in block direction are aligned as near as possible.
            In vertical writing mode, the right edge of the target word and the right edge of the parallel-note are aligned. In horizontal writing mode, the upper edge of the target word and the upper edge of the parallel-note are aligned (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_26-en"></a>).</p>
          <figure id="fig3_2_26-en"> <img src="images/img3_2_26.png" alt="Example one of headnotes in vertical writing mode" width="324" height="456" />

          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>After these methods are applied, if the parallel-note text overflows, there needs to be some arrangement to handle that within the page. In vertical writing mode, the parallel-note positions are shifted to the right, and in horizontal writing mode, the parallel-note positions are shift above (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2_27-en"></a>). This arrangement is done until the first parallel-note reaches  the right edge in vertical writing mode or  the top edge in horizontal writing mode. If there is more overflow, the overflowed part of the parallel-notes is set at the top of the next page. In vertical writing mode, arrangements may be applied not within the page but within the spread.</p>

          <aside class="note">
            <p>When the overflowed part of the parallel-notes is set on the next page, there are cases where a line is inserted between the overflowed part and the parallel-notes in the page.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When there are multiple parallel-notes  set in the same page or the same spread, the following methods are applied:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>The line gap between the two different parallel-notes is explicitly specified, or the value for the line gap within the parallel-note itself is applied if there is no explicit instruction. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The arrangement of positioning is done as follows. First, the parallel-note positions are settled from first parallel-note, and second parallel-note and after is set with the instructed line gap or corresponding position to the target word in the main text. Second, if the parallel-note will overflow, the parallel-notes are set from the bottom of parallel-note area. Third, if the parallel-notes still overflow, parallel-notes are set from the top of the parallel-note area with appropriate line gap, and the overflowed part of the parallel-notes is set at the top of the next page or next spread.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>When the parallel-notes will overflow to the next page or next spread, the instructed line gap is inserted between the overflowed part of the parallel-notes and the original parallel-note part. The realm after the overflowed part is the area for the original parallel-notes. </p>

      <h4 id="specification_of_the_position_of_illustrations">Specification of the Position of Illustrations</h4>
      <p>There are two methods for specifying the position of <a class="termref" href="#term.illustrations">illustrations</a>. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>With this method, first, the in slip for the <a class="termref" href="#term.main-text">body of the book</a> is  created. Then, for each page, layout processing is executed, and the positioning of illustrations on a specific page and its position in that page are specified. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>With this method, the relation between the main text and the illustration is specified, and the position of the illustration
            within the page is specified only in principle. </p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>Normally, if there are many illustrations inserted, method "a" is used. If there are not so many illustrations, method "b" is
              used. With method "b", the concrete page for a given figure is determined as the result of the layout process. Hence, it is
              often the case that the choice of odd page or even page for a figure is determined as a result of the layout process. </p>
          </aside>
          <aside class="note">

            <p>Illustrations are often accompanied by <a class="termref" href="#term.caption">captions</a> or <a class="termref" href="#term.note">notes</a>. Captions are normally positioned below the illustration. Captions also frequently include illustration numbers. The <a class="termref" href="#term.character-size">character size</a> in captions is smaller than in the main text, and often a different <a class="termref" href="#term.font">font</a> is used. If the caption stretches across more than 2 lines, <a class="termref" href="#term.line-gap">inter-line spacing</a> is not too large, so that the caption looks compact. If the font of the caption is changed, the whole caption will be in
              a <a class="termref" href="#term.japanese-gothic-face">gothic typeface</a>, or only the illustration number will be in a gothic typeface. The latter case means a moderate emphasis of the illustration and can be used for putting the figure into the background

    </section>
    <section>
      <h4 id="basic_concepts_about_illustration_positioning">Basic Concepts about Illustration Positioning</h4>
      <p>When the position of an illustration within a page is specified only by the relation between illustration and
        main text, it is desirable that the explanation of the illustration in the main text and the illustration are as close as
        possible to each other. </p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>Depending on the size of an illustration, it may not be possible to have references to the illustration and the illustration
          itself on the same page. In such cases, the following considerations for illustration positioning are taken into account. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>It is better to position the illustration on the page after the page with references to the illustration, and not on the page
              before the references. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Sometimes there are no references to an illustration, but an explanation of the illustration appears before it. That means that
              it is not possible to avoid in every case that illustrations appear on the page before (or after) the references. If the illustration
              and its references are on the same <a class="termref" href="#term.spread">spread</a> it is often possible to be tolerant with illustration positioning. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Many aspects have to be taken into account with regards to the positioning of illustrations. This means that, even if automatic processing
              is used as much as possible, according to the layout result it will be necessary to change the position of references or the size
              of the illustration manually. </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </aside>

    <section>
      <h4 id="requirements_for_illustration_positioning_in_vertical_mayout">Requirements for Illustration Positioning in Vertical Layout</h4>
      <p>For vertical layout as in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1-en"></a>, the following requirements for illustration positioning apply. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>In books, the spread is the basis for the design, and the illustration position is specified towards the head and fore-edge.
            Hence it is necessary to use the spread as the basis for the specification of the position. Concretely it means that the position
            has to correspond to "towards the fore-edge" or towards the <a class="termref" href="#term.gutter">gutter</a>. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In vertical layout, often the upper part of an illustration touches the head of the hanmen, or the left or right part touches
            the fore-edge. This makes it necessary to position the illustration relying on the hanmen (or the final size). Furthermore, even
            if the complete hanmen is occupied by the illustration, depending on the illustration content, in some cases it is better style
            to  position the illustration about 1mm inside the hanmen. </p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>The reason for the positioning 1mm inside the hanmen is that in that way, the character area of the hanmen and the illustration appear
              to be arranged together. </p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>As said in "b", normally, it is appropriate to specify a position starting from the hanmen. However, in the case of a <a class="termref" href="#term.bleed">bleed</a>, it is necessary to jut out of the final size to position the illustration (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_8-en"></a>). Furthermore, in such cases it is possible to specify an intuitive position, if  the specification of the position uses the edge of
            the trim size as the origin (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_4-en"></a>). </p>
          <figure id="fig3_4-en"> <img src="images/img3_4.png" alt="Bleed positioning" width="465" height="277" />
            <figcaption>Bleed positioning</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>If base text is placed around illustrations, normally the smallest space size between them is specified. The smallest space size is
            the character size used for the main text (which is specified for the <a href="#term.kihon-hanmen" class="termref">kihon-hanmen</a>), or the line gap (also specified for the <a href="#term.kihon-hanmen" class="termref">kihon-hanmen</a>). It is also necessary to specify the <a class="termref" href="#term.line-length">line length</a> of surrounding text as  an integral multiple of the character size in use. </p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>Here an example is shown of the smallest and largest space size between an illustration and characters, for a character size of 9
              points in the kihon-hanmen and 8 points for line gap (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_4a-en"></a>). </p>

          <aside class="note">
            <p>If possible, it is appropriate to unify the space between illustrations and surrounding main texts. For example it can be unified
              to be 1.5 times  the character size used in the main text. Depending on the size of the illustration it may be that
              such unification is not possible, since it is necessary that the line-length be an integral multiple of the character size in use.
              But, at the design step, some modifications of the illustration size are possible. Accordingly it is possible to unify the
              space around illustrations, by creating an overview of the various sizes of illustrations and the related numbers of characters
              and lines, and choose from that overview the applicable numbers and apply these during the design step. </p>

          <p>If the number of characters of main text to be placed around illustrations in inline direction is very small (for example 1/4 of the line length
            of the kihon-hanmen or less than 9 characters), it is better to not place the characters and leave the space free (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_5-en"></a>). Also, as shown in the left part of <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_6-en"></a>, for the arrangement of illustrations in the block direction, it is bad style and should be avoided to have only one line

Also in these cases, the illustrations are not placed - like in vertical layout - at the side of the head, but often in linkage
            with the main text. That is, the illustrations are placed on the page with their explanations, beside  the mid paragraph anchor point  or on

      <h4 id="basic_ideas_about_illustration_positioning_in_JISX4051">Basic Ideas about Illustration Positioning in JIS X 4051</h4>
      <p>To provide some background for the preceding discussion, the main definitions of JIS X 4051 will be introduced below.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>JIS X 4051 defines two methods for illustration positioning: "relative position specification" and "absolute position specification".
            Below the definitions from this standard are described. </p>
          <p>Relative position specification: the specification of block units appears together with the flow of, say, paragraphs of the
            main text within lines. The lines are the basis for positioning, and segmentation of the line feed is not possible. ("block
            unit": a general term for blocks of figures, images etc. and tables) </p>
          <p>Absolute position specification: the specification of block units appears within the hanmen or spread. An absolute position  based
            on these is the basis for illustration placement. </p>
          <p>In the case of <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1-en"></a>, where the position is specified from two directions (from the head or the fore-edge), the absolute position specification
            method is used. </p>
          <p>As shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_2-en"></a>, <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_9-en"></a> or <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_10-en"></a>, when the position in the inline direction is given as specified, and the position in the block direction is determined depending
            on the position of the main text which refers to the block unit, the adopted method is  relative positioning (of course
            absolute positioning is possible too for placement at the head or foot ). </p>
          <p>Furthermore, JIS X 4051 defines the placement of the specification method for gutter and fore-edge with absolute positioning
            method, but not with relative positioning. It is desirable to allow for a positioning based upon a specification method of gutter and fore-edge, also for relative
            positioning. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When both  the main text (or the main paragraph in JIS X 4051 terminology) and the illustration are on the same page, either
            method does not raise any problem unless there is only a single line of the main text to be laid out before the illustration
            in the block direction on the top of the content page area or after the illustration at the bottom as shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_6-en"></a> or in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_11-en"></a>. The problematic cases are where, via the relation to the corresponding text or the size of the illustration, the illustration
            juts out of the the hanmen or the area of the column, or the page of the main text and the page of the illustration are different.
            About these issues JIS X 4051 makes the following definitions. </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>With the relative positioning method, the illustration is placed directly after the line in which the anchor in the main text
                is defined. If, as a result of the positioning, the illustration juts out of the hanmen or the column, the length of the part of
                the illustration inside the hanmen or the column (a), and the part outside the area (b) will be compared (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_13-en"></a>). Since it should be avoided (if possible) that an illustration appears before its explanation in the main text, the comparison
                uses not a simple 1/2, but a relative weight. If concretely like in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_13-en"></a> the relation between <i class="quantity">a</i> and <i class="quantity">b</i> is <i class="quantity">a</i> ≧ 2<i class="quantity">b</i>, the illustration is placed on that page (in the final stage), and the lines which overlap with the area of the illustration
                (including the line with the anchor) are put on the following page, they are put out (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_14-en"></a>). </p>

              <aside class="note">
                <p>There are many examples where the explanation of the illustration is not necessarily at a restricted, specific place, but it
                  is within a given area. Hence, up to a certain extend it is regarded as OK to be permissive and have the anchor later. </p>
              </aside>
              <aside class="note">
                <p>It is not  in every case  the right approach to set the relative weight of  parts outside the area and inside the area to 1/3 (1:2).
                  Consequently, it is safe to assume that these proportions can be modified. Nevertheless, when specifying 1/3, many cases can
                  be matched. </p>
              </aside>
              <aside class="note">
                <p>In the case of taking the illustration out, the free space on the page is naturally filled with text from the main text of
                  the following page. For this purpose, processing is necessary to put text from that part of the main text on the following
                  page. </p>
              </aside>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The same basic ideas apply also for absolute positioning. However, the portions to be compared are different than with relative
                positioning. </p>
              <p>With the absolute positioning method, first the distance between the specification of the position via the anchor in the main
                text, and the distance to the end of the area of the hanmen or the column are calculated (see <i class="quantity">a</i> in the left part of <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_17-en"></a>). Next, as a result of the positioning of the illustration, the anchor will be moved. If the moved anchor is on the same
                page, the illustration will be placed on that page. </p>
              <p>If the anchor has moved to the following page, the distance between that anchor and the beginning of the area of the hanmen or
                the column will be calculated (see <i class="quantity">b</i> in the right part of <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_17-en"></a>). </p>

              </figure>
              <p>In addition, <i class="quantity">a</i> and <i class="quantity">b</i> are compared. If <i class="quantity">a</i> ≧ 2<i class="quantity">b</i>, the illustration is placed on the page where the anchor appeared first. In the case of <i class="quantity">a</i> &lt; 2<i class="quantity">b</i>, the illustration is placed after the page where the anchor appeared first. In the example in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_17-en"></a>, <i class="quantity">a</i> &lt; 2<i class="quantity">b</i>, the illustration is moved to the left page (page 13), see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_18-en"></a>. </p>

              <p><a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_19-en"></a> shows an example where an anchor firstly appears in the 5th line of a page (page 12), and as a result of illustration placement, the
                anchor is moved to the second line of the left page (page 13). In this case <i class="quantity">a</i> ≧ 2<i class="quantity">b</i>, and the illustration is left on the right page (page 12). </p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In addition some more definitions related to illustration positioning are introduced below.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>With the absolute positioning method, a stranded line before or after the illustration in the block direction can be predicted
                and hence avoided. In contrast, with the relative positioning method, it happens that a stranded line in the block direction
                is left out as a result. This is bad style, and JIS X 4051 defines a processing method for avoiding it. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Several elements come in between e.g. paragraphs, and it is necessary to adapt the area of the hanmen size
                in the block direction. For this case, there are several approaches about style designed via the kihon-hanmen (character size, line
                spacing etc.) and different style elements: the approach of unifying the space around such elements, or the approach of maintaining
                (if at all possible) the position of lines specified during the design of the hanmen. JIS X 4051 defines two methods for this topic
                (see section <a class="sec_ref" href="#block_direction_setting_process_of_lines_paragraphs"></a>). </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>When the space around an illustration is maintained and main text
                is inserted in the free area, it is necessary to adapt the line length to integral multiple of the characters used. Such aspects are
                defined in JIS X 4051 as well (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_1-en"></a>). </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Also, if the number of surrounding characters is extremely low, it is better to keep the surroundings free. If the number of
                surrounding characters is 1/4 of the line length of the kihon-hanmen or 9 characters below, JIS X 4051 specifies that no main text should surround
                an illustration. In <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_9-en"></a> or <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_10-en"></a> the illustration is placed midway down the page using the relative positioning method, so it is necessary to unify the space above
                and below the illustration. JIS X 4051 also provides definitions for this aspect (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_20-en"></a>). </p>
              <figure id="fig3_20-en"> <img src="images/img3_20.png" alt="Space between an illustration placed midway a page and the characters above and below it" width="211" height="254" />

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>For positioning of illustrations relying on the spread, JIS X 4051 defines a method using the absolute positioning method (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#processing_of_tables_allocated_in_a_spread"></a>)..</p>

            <p>The notations of OMOTEKEI, URAKEI and CHUUBOSOKEI are inherited from the letterpress printing age, and have been used in computerized type setting. The physical shape of the border in letterpress printing is shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_4_7-en"></a>. OMOTEKEI is printed with the sharp edge  and URAKEI is printed with bottom flat edge. The width of the top edge of CHUUBOSOKEI is cast between the top edge of OMOTEKEI and the bottom edge of OMOTEKEI, so CHUUBOSOKEI can be used as URAKEI when the bottom edge is used. Furthermore, in letterpress printing, the width of OMOTEKEI, CHUUBOSOKEI and URAKEI are different but the width of  the bottom of the borders is the same as each other. However, there are two kinds of bottom of border, one is 1/8 of one point, the other is 1/8 of one GOU (i.e. 10.5 points), namely 1.3 point. When the GOU-KEISEN (5 border) is used, the URAKEI is  thicker than the POINT-KEISEN.</p>

Accordingly, by this description KEISEN is treated as if the width of KEISEN is zero. OMOTEKEI can be regarded as zero width, however,  the width of URAKEI should be considered, and cell padding is measured from the edge of the KEISEN. In this document, the cell padding is measured from the edge of KEISEN. However,  for OMOTEKEI, the difference between the center of KEISEN and the edge of KEISEN can be ignored. </p>

          <p>The width of each row is calculated as follows: firstly, calculate the width of the widest cell content in the column, and add space  the size of a half em of the character size of the cell to both edges of the text. Secondly, adjust for the multiples of the character size used for the table. Thirdly, if the cell contents among different rows are similar, the width of the rows are set the same (in the fourth and fifth rows from the left). </p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>In tables with horizontal writing mode, the minimum space between the content and the KEISEN is usually a half of the basic character size of the table, and at least a fourth of the basic character size of the table. The space should not reduced to solid. </p>

The spaces between invisible KEISEN and cell content are a fourth em space of the basic table character size. Namely, it can be said that the visible line gaps are one half em except for the header row. In this example, there are two line cells as a header, the block direction spaces between KEISEN and cell contents are set with a minimum gap of one fourth em (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_4_6-en"></a> a and b). The reason is not to make a space between KEISEN and cell contents for other one line cells. </p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>It is basically recommended that the spaces between visible KEISEN and cell content should be a half em and between invisible KEISEN and cell content should be a quarter em from an aesthetic view point. However, when the table is large enough to occupy one full page, it might seem that the half em space sizes are too large. In such cases, the space sizes  may be reduced to a quarter em, and  exceptional spaces may be set  every five or ten lines. </p>

      <h4 id="processing_of_tables_allocated_in_a_spread">Processing of Tables Allocated in a Spread</h4>
      <p>When a table is  allocated in a spread, it is desirable to allocate within the spread. However, sometimes it is impossible to allocate in the same spread where the table is linked to. In such cases, the spread where the table is allocated is decided as follows (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#basic_ideas_about_illustration_positioning_in_JISX4051"></a>): Firstly, calculate the distance between the anchor position of the base text and the last position of the spread (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_4_12-en"></a>). Secondly, calculate the distance between the original position of the anchor and the position of the anchor when the table is allocated at the spread where the anchor was originally positioned, and consequently the position of the anchor is overflowed to the next spread (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_4_12_2-en"></a>). Finally, compare these two distances, and decide whether to  allocate the table to the original spread or next spread (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_4_12_3-en"></a>).</p>

      <p> The next problem is where to divide a table. In some senses, illustrations can be divided wherever specified or at the kihon-hanmen border. On the other hand, there are some limitations and issues to consider when dividing tables as follows: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Tables are divided at the border of rows or columns, with condition that the border between the header and adjoining cells shall not be divided, also it is prohibited to divide just after captions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When there is a visible KEISEN at the expected dividing position, the common approach is as follows: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>When the outer frame KEISENs of inline direction are visible, the top side KEISEN at the dividing position shall be invisible and the bottom side KEISEN at the dividing position shall be visible (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_4_13-en"></a>).</p>

      <p>The space between paragraphs is usually same as line gap specified for the paragraphs.</p>
      <aside class="note">
        <p>JIS X 4051 determines that "the space between paragraphs  where different character sizes are specified  shall be the line gap specified for kihon-hanmen".</p>
      </aside>
      <p>Sometimes the space between paragraphs is specified. JIS X 4051 determines the space before the paragraph as "space before paragraph"  and the space after the paragraph as "space after paragraph". When the "space before paragraph" or the "space after paragraph" is specified,  the space will be kept between paragraphs. Thus "space before paragraph" or "space after paragraph" in the JIS X 4051 context is usually specified with absolute space sizes (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_5_5-en"></a>)  or a number of lines (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_5_5_2-en"></a>). </p>

      <h4 id="adjustment_of_processing_of_realm_in_block_direction">Adjustment of Processing of Realm in Block Direction</h4>
      <p>Except for the last line before the page break or new recto, the very last line set at the bottom of a page or a column is set to be aligned to the border of the kihon-hanmen or the column area. However, sometimes exceptions arise as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Paragraphs and other objects set using a different character size or line gap from the kihon-hanmen. If there is no adjustment, the bottom of the last line will not be aligned to the bottom of the kihon-hanmen or column area in the block direction. Examples are block headings and end notes  inserted after a paragraph.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>When setting objects which are prohibited at the bottom of a kihon-hanmen or the bottom of a column, such as block headings,  some blanks may appear on the previous page or in the previous column.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>In these cases, there are two ways to solve the issue. Hereafter, procedure (a) will be called "adjustment processing in block direction".</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Set  the bottom of the line aligned to the bottom of the kihon-hanmen or the bottom of the column  in the block direction, and move blanks to appropriate positions within the kihon-hanmen or the column.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Let the blanks appearing at the bottom of the hanmen or the column in block direction remain as they are.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are some issues related to the adjustment procedure in the block direction as follows:</p>
      <p>First,  make best efforts to reduce such cases.
        Some examples of how not to let objects affect the alignment to the kihon-hanmen lines of following objects are:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Block heading:  the  area of the block heading is specified by an integral number of lines (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#processing_of_gyoudori"></a>).</p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>Some mathematical formulas  where the block direction width is wider than the hanmen or column character size, like fractional formulas,  can be set in two ways. One is to specify the space of the area with a number of lines and when the area has some aligned space  in the block direction  the adjustment is done within the hanmen or within the column.</p>
          </aside>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Block direction space between paragraphs: to specify the size of a space with a number of lines (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#processing_of_spaces_between_paragraphs"></a>). </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Other cases  such as Haiku with larger characters,  where the space of the block is specified with a number of lines.</p>
          <aside class="note">
            <p>When haiku and other short texts are quoted in a block area  the inter-letter-space is sometimes set as a half em or fourth em,  or  by setting the length of the line and setting the text using the even inter-letter spacing method (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig2_5_9-en"></a>).</p>
          </aside>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>When there is a following object  and the properties of the object are different from the properties of the kihon-hanmen,  set the object to align with the bottom  edge of hanmen or column  and adjust the space between the object and the text before. Examples are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Footnotes in horizontal writing mode (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#processing_of_footnotes_in_horizontal_writing_mode"></a>).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sidenotes in vertical writing mode (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#processing_of_sidenote_in_vertical_writing_mode"></a>).</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>When there is following text and objects  and there is a blank as the result of setting text and objects with specified spaces, adjustment is done with the block direction space among text lines and objects. Examples are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Cases where an illustration or a table is inserted with "relative positioning and no turn around mode" in terms of JIS X 4051 (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#basic_ideas_about_illustration_positioning_in_JISX4051"></a>). Process should be implemented as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>When only one illustration or table with "relative positioning and no turn around mode" is allocated at the top or the bottom of the hanmen or the column,  the adjustment of the hanmen or the column is done between the illustration or the table  and the main text (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_6_1-en"></a>). </p>
              <aside class="note">
                <p>When only one illustration or table with absolute position indication without turn around is set at the very top or the very bottom of the hanmen or the column in block direction, the process is implemented as for case 1.</p>

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>When only one illustration or table with "relative positioning and no turn around mode" is allocated in the middle of a hanmen or a column  the adjustment of the hanmen or the column is done evenly in the space before and after the illustration or table (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_6_2-en"></a>). </p>

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>When two or more illustrations or tables are inserted, a fractional blank is distributed to multiple spaces between main text and illustrations or tables (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_10-en"></a>).</p>
              <aside class="note">
                <p>When two or more illustrations are inserted, if the adjustment is done at more than one position, the line position of main text might be moved from the kihon-hanmen. To avoid that, one approach is to set lines after the illustration with alignment to the kihon-hanmen line position (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_11-en"></a>). In processing like <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_10-en"></a>, the size of the space before and after illustrations are very similar, however, in cases like <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_ad1_11-en"></a>, the size of the space before and after one illustration are same, but, the sizes of spaces before and after different illustrations might be different from each other. </p>
              </aside>
              <aside class="note">
                <p>When the illustrations or tables with absolute position indication without turn around are set at the very top and the very bottom of the hanmen or column area, the issue mentioned in (note 1) will also arise. There are also two approaches. One is to make spaces before and after illustrations or tables equal, and the other is to force the line position so that it is aligned to the line position of the kihon-hanmen.</p>
              </aside>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cases where an endnote is inserted (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#processing_of_endnotes_in_vertical_writing_mode_or_horizontal_writing_mode"></a>). In these cases, basically the adjustment is done between the endnote and the main text just after the endnote. However, when endnotes are only set at the very end of the hanmen or the column, the adjustment is done between the endnote and the main text before the endnote.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cases where an inserted quotation block has a smaller character size and narrower line gap than the kihon-hanmen. In these cases, the adjustment processing in block direction is basically the same as for endnotes inserted between paragraphs (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_6_3-en"></a>, <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig3_6_3_2-en"></a>). </p>

      </ol>
      <p>When there is no place for the adjustment even if it is necessary, the blank at the very bottom of the hanmen or the column area in block direction is left as it is. One  example is the blank after  endnotes occupying  one full page.</p>
      <p>There are cases that there is not enough blank to set the following object and there happen to remain blank at the bottom of the realm of the hanmen or the column. The examples to let the rest blanck as is are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Cases where the heading is set at the bottom of the hanmen or column  and the heading is moved to the next page or next column (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#processing_of_gyoudori_heading_set_in_the_bottom_of_the_page"></a>).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cases where the size of the space before or after the paragraph is specified  and the paragraph is set at the top or bottom of a hanmen or a column  (see <a class="sec_ref" href="#processing_of_spaces_between_paragraphs"></a>). </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cases where there are no dividable positions in the first part of a dividable table  and  the table is set at the top of the next page or the next column  and there remains some blank space at the bottom of the previous hanmen or the previous column.

              <p> The reason for the distinction between the two half em spaces ("be" stands for "before" and "af" stands for "after") is necessary  because there are cases where a line is composed with different sizes of characters, as shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_a1-1-en"></a> where it is necessary to disambiguate which em size we are referring to. Likewise, other instances of the notation "be" or "af" in this appendix are for the same disambiguation.</p>

        <p>The preferred spacing between <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-05">middle dots (cl-05)</a> and the line end is a quarter em.

        <p>In this document, character spacing between a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stop (cl-06)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">comma (cl-07)</a> and a following <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-05">middle dot (cl-05)</a> is the sum of the half em space of the full stop or comma and the quarter em space of the middle dot. On the other hand, JIS X 4051 classifies <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a> as a subset of <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a>, and, therefore, where a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">comma (cl-07)</a> is followed by a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-05">middle dot (cl-05)</a> in JIS X 4051 the character spacing between them is just the quarter em space of the following <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-05">middle dot (cl-05)</a>.</p>

The alternative is to set solid (JIS X 4051 specifies that the space after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stop (cl-06)</a> is a half em and the space after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">comma (cl-07)</a> is solid, see <a class="sec_ref" href="#positioning_of_closing_brackets_full_stops_commas_and_middle_dots_at_line_end"></a>).</p>

However, if it is required to conform to JIS X 4051, ruby text shall not be extended over the katakana because katakana characters belong to the ideographic character class in JIS X 4051.</p>
        <p>There are alternative methods, one of which is to allow ruby text to be extended up to the size of the ruby character over any character including <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic (cl-19)</a> as well as <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> characters, and another  is NOT to allow ruby text to be extended over any character from <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic characters (cl-19)</a>.</p>

      <li>
        <p>Ruby text can be extended up to the size of the ruby character over the <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-14">full-width ideographic space (cl-14)</a>. The preferred approach is to apply the same for the full-width line head indent at the beginning of a paragraph.

      <li>
        <p>When two adjacent characters belong to the same <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-21">ornamented character complex (cl-21)</a> run, set them according to the method explained in <a class="sec_ref" href="#superscripts_and_superscripts">3.7.1 Superscripts and Superscripts</a>.

Note that <span class="character">KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT "・"</span> can be used either as a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-25">unit symbol (cl-25)</a> or as a middle dot. When it is used as a <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-25">unit symbol (cl-25)</a>, both preceding and trailing spacing of <span class="character">KATAKANA MIDDLE DOT "・"</span> shall be zero.</p>
      </li>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Follow the principle by applying some sort of line adjustment. In this case, <span class="character">IDEOGRAPHIC ITERATION MARK "々"</span> remains in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-09">iteration marks (cl-09)</a>.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Allow <span class="character">IDEOGRAPHIC ITERATION MARK "々"</span> to be placed either at the line head or at the head of an inline cutting note. In this case, the character shall be treated as part of the <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic characters (cl-19)</a> class.</p>
          </li>

        <p>The difference between the strict and the very strict rules described above is as follows. The very strict line-breaking rule is the convention that attaches greater importance to the line-start prohibition and unbreakable character rules, and therefore it is more likely to lead to the need for line adjustment processing. In comparison, the strict line-breaking rule is the convention that weakens line-start prohibition in order to avoid line adjustment as much as possible  to make it easier to achieve solid setting. In other words, the very strict rule is for the best appearance at the line head, while the strict rule is  best to avoid inter-character space adjustment.</p>

(For more detail on line adjustment, see <a class="sec_ref" href="#line_adjustment"></a>.) In the process of line adjustment by inter-character space reduction, the first place to look  (the first stage of inter-character space reduction in priority order) is for <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-26">Western word spaces (cl-26)</a>, each of which is reducible equally,  to leave a minimum of a quarter em space (or a one fifth em space) with respect to the corresponding character size. The tables are for the second and subsequent stages of inter-character space reduction in priority order, assuming the first stage of the reduction for <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-26">Western word spaces (cl-26)</a> is already done. The default unadjusted space between two adjacent characters of given character classes shall be determined according to <a class="sec_ref" href="#spacing_between_characters"></a>.</p>
  <p>There are several conventions for line adjustment, especially when it is to be achieved by inter-character space reduction. Table 3 follows the method adopted by this document, Table 4 supplies an alternative way specified by JIS X 4051, and Table 5, taking partially different approaches from the previous two, represents yet another method which can be seen in books or other publications.</p>

On the other hand, while JIS X 4051 specifies to pad with a half em space after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a> at the line end, which is not allowed to reduce this space for line adjustment, Table 3 and 5 allow the removal of the default half em space after <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-02">closing brackets (cl-02)</a>, <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-06">full stops (cl-06)</a> and <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-07">commas (cl-07)</a> at the line end for line adjustment.

  <section>
    <h3 id="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_1">Principles of Jukugo-Ruby Distribution: Part 1</h3>
    <p>The following are principles of jukugo-ruby distribution,  taking account of the structure of a kanji compound word and the type of script of the adjacent characters surrounding the compound word.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Because the purpose of ruby annotation, including jukugo-ruby, is to supply the reading of each base kanji character, attach each run of ruby text which represents the reading to the corresponding base kanji character.</p>
        <p>If each run of ruby characters representing the reading of a given base <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> participating in a kanji compound word is less than or equal to two, attach each ruby text to the corresponding base <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_a6-1-en">Fig. F.1</a>). The following figures supply a pair of examples of the same text per line, with and without character frames displayed. Ruby characters and base characters in the same color indicate that they correspond to each other. Those <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic characters (cl-19)</a> which are not part of the jukugo-ruby, and which, therefore, ruby characters are not allowed to overhang, are presented in yet different colors. </p>

          <figcaption>Jukugo-ruby distribution 1.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Because the intention when using jukugo-ruby is to handle the kanji compound word (jukugo) as one object, a run of ruby text for a base <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic character (cl-19)</a> is allowed to overhang the adjacent base character participating to the same compound word, up to a maximum of one em in the ruby character size (alternatively, the maximum size for the ruby overhang can be one and a half em, but the explanation hereafter assumes the maximum overhang to be one em in the ruby size.).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When the number of ruby characters is so great that the length of the ruby text is longer than that of the base characters forming the kanji compound word, the decision to what extent the ruby text can overhang the adjacent characters, if allowed, shall be made according to the methods explained in <a class="sec_ref" href="#adjustments_of_ruby_with_length_longer_than_that_of_the_base_characters"></a>. The explanation hereafter adopts one of the methods that prohibits any ruby text to overhang <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic characters (cl-19)</a> but allows ruby to overhang the characters of a certain character class such as <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> or <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-16">katakana (cl-16)</a>, up to a maximum of one em in the ruby character size.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_2">Principles of Jukugo-Ruby Distribution: Part 2</h3>
    <p>In <a href="#term.letterpress-printing" class="termref">letterpress printing</a>, ruby text was composed according to "principles part one" in the previous section, but on a case by case basis. Therefore, ruby texts were often composed differently for the same kanji compound word in the same situation. In some cases they differed according to the person in charge of the composition. In this section, one consistent method of ruby composition is presented as "principles part two", which is established with reference to those adopted in books and other publications.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>As long as jukugo-ruby can fit the kanji compound word by allowing ruby characters to overhang an adjacent base character that is part of the same compound word or those characters adjacent to the compound word which are of a certain character class such as <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>, inter-character spacing between base characters in the kanji compound word and that between the kanji compound word and the adjacent characters, should not be expanded.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When a base character is accompanied by three or more ruby characters, decide the positioning of the ruby characters in the following order.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Let a run of ruby text for a given base character overhang either or both of the adjacent base characters up to a maximum of one em in the ruby character size. The first choice should be the succeeding base character. For example, suppose we have a kanji compound word consisting of three ideographic characters, each of which is accompanied by three, two and one ruby characters respectively. In this case, let the third character for the first base character overhang the second base character, by letting the second ruby character for the second base character overhang the third base character (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_a6-2-en"></a>). In cases where there is no possible arrangement of ruby characters that follows the first choice, let them overhang the preceding base characters as in the following illustrations. <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_a6-3-en"></a> shows examples where the succeeding base characters overhang, while <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_a6-4-en"></a> are examples where the preceding base characters overhang since there is no arrangement of ruby characters to take the succeeding ones.</p>

            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When there is no possible arrangement of ruby characters even by allowing them to overhang the base characters participating to the same kanji compound word, at maximum by one em in ruby character size, then look at the adjacent characters in the main text surrounding the kanji compound word if they are of such character classes which ruby characters are allowed to overhang as in <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a>. If they are, allow ruby characters to overhang these characters. The same principle applies here as to the choice of the adjacent (base or non-base) character to be the succeeding one in priority. For example, suppose we have a kanji compound word consisting of two ideographic characters, each of which is accompanied by three and two ruby characters respectively. In this case, let the third ruby character for the first base character overhang the second base character, by letting the second ruby character for the second base character overhang the succeeding non-base character of <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-15">hiragana (cl-15)</a> class or the like (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_a6-5-en"></a>). The following are some examples. <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_a6-6-en"></a> shows examples of ruby characters that overhang the succeeding non-base characters and <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_a6-7-en"></a> are examples of ruby characters that overhang the preceding non-base characters since there is no possible arrangement to allow ruby characters to take the succeeding ones. The last illustration shows examples of ruby characters that overhang both of the non-base characters adjacent to the kanji compound word (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_a6-8-en"></a>).</p>

            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If the succeeding character in the main text adjacent to the kanji compound word accompanied by ruby characters is of a character class which does not allow ruby to overhang, as with <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic characters (cl-19)</a>, then look at the preceding character and allow ruby to overhang the character if it is of a character class that allows it. If the examples shown in <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_a6-5-en"></a> or <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_a6-6-en"></a> had <a class="characterClass" href="#cl-19">ideographic characters (cl-19)</a> next to the kanji compound word accompanied by ruby characters, let ruby characters  overhang the preceding character in all cases but two examples with "居候" and "古代紫" (see <a class="figure_ref" href="#fig_a6-9-en"></a>).</p>
            <figure id="fig_a6-9-en"> <img src="images/img_a6_9.png" alt="Jukugo-ruby distribution 9 (examples of ruby characters to overhang the preceding non-base characters)." width="325" height="373" />

            </figure>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When both of the preceding and succeeding characters adjacent to the kanji compound word accompanied by ruby characters are of character classes which do not allow ruby to overhang, or there are too many ruby characters and it is impossible to fit them in using the approaches described above, the last thing to consider is to fit them in by expanding the inter-character spacing of the kanji compound word. There could be various methods, depending on what priorities are chosen, and in fact many different ways have been adopted. The following section will explain one of these methods.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>To sum up the aforementioned, first try to let ruby characters overhang other base characters associated with the same kanji compound word, then look for adjacent non-base characters to see if they allow ruby to overhang. Finally when both approaches still cannot settle the positioning of the ruby characters, combine the method of expanding inter-character spacing of the compound word with the previous two.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="principles_of_jukugoruby_distribution_with_intercharacter_space_expansion">Principles of Jukugo-Ruby Distribution with Inter-Character Space Expansion</h3>
    <p>Principles for a method of jukugo-ruby distribution which allows inter-character spacing to expand, are as follows.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Try first to let ruby characters overhang other base characters associated with the same kanji compound word. If ruby still does not fit, then look for adjacent non-base characters that allow ruby to overhang. Lastly when both approaches still cannot settle the positioning of the ruby characters, combine the method of expanding inter-character spacing of the compound word with the previous two.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Inter-character spacing can be expanded only for those base characters which are accompanied by more than two ruby characters.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The total amount of inter-character spacing should be determined as follows.</p>
        <p>Total inter-character space = (the sum of the length of those ruby characters forced out from the corresponding base character) - (the sum of the length of those ruby characters which overhang other base characters) - (the sum of the length of those ruby characters which overhang other non-base characters).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Distribute the amount of space across those base characters accompanied by more than two ruby characters in accordance with the number of ruby characters (or the length of ruby characters when set solid).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For each base character, expand the preceding and succeeding inter-character space equally by  half of the assigned space. Note that, depending on the position of the base character, it could be the expansion of inter-character spacing between two base characters, or it could be the expansion between the base character and a non-base character.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In a special case where a jukugo-ruby character complex is at the line-head and the base character and the ruby character at the line-head are supposed to be aligned, expand only the succeeding inter-character space of the base character by all of the assigned space. Similarly, when a jukugo-ruby character complex is at the line-end and the base character and the ruby character at the line-end are supposed to be aligned, expand the preceding inter-character space of the base character by all of the assigned space.</p>
